When equipment, materials, or supplies are scarce, or out of reach and time is short, or an untrained craftsperson is taking a stab at a new project, the item might be defined as Improvised. This equipment is serviceable, but made of either extremely shoddy craftsmanship, or even just a random item from the environment.

For example, using a branch as an improvised mace, a torn strip of clothing as a bandage or a chair leg as a splint, eating uncooked foraged edibles, or even lifting a weapon that you've never held long enough to become familiar with. Using broken or damaged equipment for it's intended purpose also quantifies it as improvised, such as a frayed climbing rope, or a rusty, pockmarked knife.

- Each level of improvised status imposes 2 Bad Luck.
- The Fail-And consequences for improvised equipment should involve the equipment becoming unusably broken in some way, such as the rope snapping and becoming unspun, or the knife shattering.
