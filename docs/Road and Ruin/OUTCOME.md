The Outcome system is designed to help steer the narrative in ways that actually have an impact, rewarding character skills.
- Uses a d10-based scale that's 50/50 Success/Failure down the middle.
- Slides the centerpoint threshold up the scale with more negative modifiers, and down the scale for positive modifiers.
- Rolling 5 or more away from the centerpoint creates dramatic outcomes. FAIL/AND fails with additional setbacks or cost, WIN/AND succeeds in less time or cost or with additional quality.
- Rolling 1 or more away from the centerpoint adds a slight nuance. FAIL/BUT fails, but gains some advantage for a future roll, WIN/BUT barely succeeds, but with some complication or cost.
- Up to 5 points for each of up to 2 different proficiencies can act as positive bonuses, bringing the difficulty down. MEDICINE 2 + HERBALISM 1 would reduce the centerpoint of by 3 points.
- The more difficult a situation, the higher the baseline difficulty. If an adult human expects to have Strength 3, and a task should be a little hard, each point below Strength 4 inflicts a 1-difficulty penalty.
- EXAMPLE: Making a precise surgical cut while operating on a creature might need at least Medicine 3, so the difficulty threshold slides up the scale three points, making the minimum number for success a 9 instead of a 6. Three points of Medicine would be needed to reduce the baseline to normal.


| FAIL/AND | FAIL  | FAIL/BUT | WIN/BUT |  WIN  | WIN/AND |
| :------: | :---: | :------: | :-----: | :---: | :-----: |
|    1     | 2 3 4 |    5     |    6    | 7 8 9 |   10    |
If difficulty increased by 3:

| FAIL/AND | FAIL  | FAIL/BUT | WIN/BUT | WIN | WIN/AND |
