With a Verbal or Gestural component that the creature not only is aware of but understands, you may offer a new Intention to a creature, often with significant bonuses attached. This 'suggestion' may be something that the creature might do ordinarily on it's own, or may never do naturally unless it was actively trained for.

In either case, the creature may be resistant to the command, especially if it's something unnatural or it acts against the [[BELIEF]]S of the creature, or threatens its wellbeing in some way. PERSUASION, INTIMIDATION, or ANIMAL HANDLING proficiencies may assist in this, as would additional training and increased level of trust.

Spending additional Spirit Points, up to an amount based on the higher of your [[WILL]], [[EMPATHY]], or [[POISE]], depending on the scenario and character, can grant you stronger force and increased power of authority, but can lead to social exhaustion and [[HOLLOWING]] over time.

>EX. A commander wants to give the order for his men to launch an assault and breach a foe's defenses, but those defenses are strong, and many have failed in this task before, for lethal consequences.
>The commander musters his courage, and will use WILL 3, PRESENCE 1 + COMMANDING 2, and gives a bold and strong order to the troops, but knowing that the risk of failure is death, a -5 penalty, the commander also spends 3 Spirit Points.
>Armed with +6 against the -5 difficulty, the Outcome is now at -1 Difficulty, or 5+ success threshold.
