When making any check or save, there is a chance that accidents could happen, or that the stars just happened to align for this event.

- ADDUP: Good Luck occurs when the number of 10s exceed the number of 1s in the dice pool, and Bad Luck occurs on the opposite. Good luck rerolls a number of the lowest-performing dice, Bad luck rerolls a number of the highest-performing dice.
- OUTCOME: Simply accounting for Fail/And, rolling a 1 can be interpreted as always meaning Fail/And, and a 10 as always meaning Success/And.

However, to have more nuance, every 2 points of Luck can force a reroll of a die. [[GOOD LUCK]] allows rerolling and taking the higher value, and [[BAD LUCK]] forces rerolling and taking the lower value.
