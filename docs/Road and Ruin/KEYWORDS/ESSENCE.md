A metaphysical concept made manifest.

- Mana Essence: A purity of creation that goes beyond simple energy mass. Condensing and crystallizing large amounts of mana brings this power into focus, for more powerful spells.
- Living Essence: A reflection of what makes you, you. Encompasses thoughts, emotions, and the ties to friends and family, as well as the behavior of animals.
- Elemental Essence: The core of what identifies an element from another element. Like mana essence, gathering and condensing this primordial energy enables more powerful representations of that element.
