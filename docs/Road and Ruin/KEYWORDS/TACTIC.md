A strategy or ploy to achieve greater results than normal. A character need not be clever enough to have invented a tactic, but should be smart enough to be able to recognize it's use and opportunity.

Tactical play is made up of several components:

| NAME                                | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TACTIC                              | A spell-like structure, that requires particular variables to be true to function as intended.                                                                                                                                                                |
| TACTIC POINTS/TACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE | By generating value and stacking the odds in your favor, opportunities arise. Tactics require a certain number of Tactic Points in play to activate, which can be anything from positioning, to resources, setup, or specific actions, like a distraction.    |
| PRIORITY                            | Nominating specific actors, targets, or resources as having tactical significance sets up the scene for a tactic to be used.                                                                                                                                  |
| DESIGNATION                         | Certain organizational roles that play a part in performing a tactic, often with a Setup or Payoff value.                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[COMMAND]]                         | Communicating clearly, confidently, decisively, and with good timing allows those who hear your commands to carry out your orders. Costs a minimum of 1SP, and prompts a resisted Poise save, based on their trust in you, and their resistance to the order. |
