'Styles' are a metric for defining the applicable use of different objects, whether they were intended that way or not.

For example, the heft, length, and weight distribution of a giant's dagger might be better suited as a greatsword for an adult human. In this case, the greatsword style would apply, for the sake of proficiency, exertion, and weapon techniques.
