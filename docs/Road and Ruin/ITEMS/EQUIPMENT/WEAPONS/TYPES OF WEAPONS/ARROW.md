A projectile fired from a [[BOW]], made of a shaft, arrowhead, and fletchings.

The arrow:
- The arrowhead can either be sharpened to a point, or a separate object, made of any rigid material, such as stone, bone, or glass.
- The shaft is normally made of wood, but modern arrows can be made of plastic or fiberglass.
- The fletchings are commonly feathers, and help to keep the arrow stable as it travels through the air.
- Has a nock at the end that helps it sit on a bow's drawstring, propelling it forward.

Different arrow modifications:
- Broadhead arrows have wide 2-4 blades, and are used for larger creatures, severing blood vessels and puncturing lungs.
- Fishspear arrows have a trident-like shape that helps it connect with fish, and prevent movement.
- Barbed arrowheads have serrations that make them difficult to remove without inflicting additional damage.
- Bodkin arrows are thick metal spikes, used to pierce mail armor.
