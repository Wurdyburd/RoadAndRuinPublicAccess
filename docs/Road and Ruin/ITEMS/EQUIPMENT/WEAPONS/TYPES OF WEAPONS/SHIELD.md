 [[BLOCK]]ing with a [[SHIELD]] acts like a weapon attack, generating bonus Armor based on your results on a dice roll. If a shield's value is Armor4, rolling a Glancing Blow adds only 2.
[[SHIELD USE]]

'Shields' refer to an item style, where a durable material is held to prevent a target from passing through the space behind the object. This usually means weapons and projectiles, but can also be a barricade to prevent the motion of people or animals.

A shield:
- Is often made of metal, wooden planks, or a mix of both, but can be any sturdy and durable material
- Is often broad, to ensure that as much of a target is blocked as possible, as well as to more evenly distribute force across its face
- Will generally have handles and/or straps to better affix the shield to the hand or arm
- Can be in many shapes and sizes, which, along with patterns painted on the face, can be a signifier of origin or allegiance
- Medium shields are usually 4-5lbs, but larger shields can be 6-14lbs

Proper shield techniques require [[SHIELD USE]] proficiency, but training in the unique abilities associated with each weight of shield requires [[DISCIPLINE]].

[[SMALL SHIELD]]
- Also referred to as a [[BUCKLER]].
- Lighter and faster, making them suitable for deflection and parrying and quick blows, but not barricading, withstanding heavy weight, blocking projectiles, or protecting the lower body.
- Domed, for the deflection of force away from the middle of the shield, with a handle.
- Better suited to [[DUEL]]s against lighter weapons like a sword or rapier.
- 45cm or 18"

[[MEDIUM SHIELD]]
- The most versatile shield, as a middle ground for size and coverage, weight, positioning, shoving, and striking.
- A [[ROUND SHIELD]] is circular in shape, and may be domed for the redirection of force. Many only have a single-handle grip, which allows it to be dropped and retrieved, but lacks stability, especially against heavier attacks. Better for quick, chaotic skirmishes.
- A[[KITE SHIELD]] or [[HEATER SHIELD]] protects more of the lower body with it's extended bottom flare, but the awkward shape and weight distribution means that the shield must be affixed to the arm via enarme straps. This grants it stability, especially against heavier attacks, but limits it's positioning, and cannot be dropped. Better for focused duels between fighters, and can be notched to fit lances when jousting.

[[LARGE SHIELD]]
- The most defensible, but least flexible shield, suitable for withstanding any attack from a single direction, preventing creature movements, and barricading, but not effective for pivoting or speed.
- A [[RIOT SHIELD]] is made of lighter material, but is designed to prevent creature advancement more than be completely bulletproof. They often have openings that allow the user to see through the shield to what's in front of them, and will have a combination handle and quick-release strap for versatility and speed of use.
- A [[PAVISE]], or [[TOWER SHIELD]], often has spikes on the bottom to plant in the ground, and is suitable to shelter behind against bombardment from projectiles, especially for a reloading archer or crossbowman. If planted firmly enough, can also be used as an obstacle.
