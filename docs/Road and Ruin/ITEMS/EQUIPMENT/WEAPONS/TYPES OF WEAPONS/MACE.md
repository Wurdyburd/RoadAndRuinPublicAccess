'Maces' refer to an item style, where a short or round weight is held by a longer handle.

Maces heads:
- Can be made of any sufficiently heavy material, including metal, wood, stone, or bone
- May be a single object, or made up of several smaller objects secured together
- Focus the weight of the impact into a small area, of either a sphere, or a small bladed point

Mace handles:
- Can be made of wood or metal, or any suitably long and sturdy rod, and may be one piece with the head
- Is usually thinner and longer, allowing for more hands to be placed along the length

Compared to clubs, maces have their weight distributed at the end. This allows for a degree of windup, and having the weight focused to a small point is effective for shattering targets, but means they aren't as effective in tight spaces or for blocking attacks.

As a weapon, maces are [[SIMPLE WEAPON]], and can be [[IMPROVISED]] with any end-heavy object, such as branches or bones, but their unusual weight distribution may mean a club is more likely.
