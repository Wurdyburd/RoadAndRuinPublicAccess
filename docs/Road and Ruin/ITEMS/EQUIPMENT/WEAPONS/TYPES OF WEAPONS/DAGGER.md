'Daggers' refer to an item style, where a small blade that is either edged, pointed, or both, is designed to slice or pierce with relative accuracy, affixed to a small handle.

The blade:
- Usually made of metal, but can be made of stone, bone, teeth, claws, glass, or barbs or thorns
- Has an edge designed for slicing, which may or may not be serrated for sawing power
- Can be one-sided, or double sided
- Can be pointed, for stabbing or puncturing holes
- Often have extra length called a tang that extends into the handle for greater durability and stability
- Can be affixed to the end of a stick, like [[SPEAR]]

The handle:
- Usually made of wood, but can be bone, or be the same object as the blade
- Only long enough for a one-handed grip, blade-up or blade-down
- Has a pommel end, used to keep the handle attached to the tang of the blade
- May have a wrapping of leather or cloth for better grip

Daggers and knives double as a general-purpose tool, for anything from severing rope, cutting up food or ingredients, skinning an animal, digging, or scraping.

Daggers are easily carried just about anywhere on one's person, such as in boots or on the leg, the hip or belt, or under the arm. These make them very effective [[QUICK DRAW]] and [[CONCEALABLE]] weapons, for self defense, or [[SNEAK ATTACKS]], and their small size mean they can target vulnerabilities, given a short enough distance and precise enough accuracy.

As a weapon, they can be defined as [[SIMPLE WEAPON]], but given their combat advantages, many advanced techniques have been developed that require [[DAGGER USE]] proficiency.

They can also be thrown with a good degree of accuracy at short ranges and if properly weighted, penetrating tip-first into a target, using [[THROWN WEAPON USE]] proficiency.

An example of an [[IMPROVISED]] dagger might be a piece of glass, a sharp bone, or a sharp stick or large thorn.
