'Natural Weapons' is an odd item style category, for while it refers to an attack pattern and has physical variables attached, the weapon is the creature itself.

Horns, teeth, claws, spines, stingers, tails, venoms, and more may be harvestable and used to attack, but instead are treated as [[IMPROVISED]] weapons of the appropriate item style.

Instead, such items are better described as a 'gore', 'bite', 'headbutt', 'claw', 'lash', 'sting', 'tail sweep', 'wing buffet', and so on, and require Touch range with the intended body part to be used.

Natural Weapons make use of the [[NATURAL WEAPONRY USE]] proficiency, if any techniques or training can be applied to the use of exotic body parts for offensive purposes.
