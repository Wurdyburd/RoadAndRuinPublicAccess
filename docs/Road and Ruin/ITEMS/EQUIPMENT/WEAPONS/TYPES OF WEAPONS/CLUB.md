'Clubs' refer to an item style, where a heavy mass of longer length is held by a smaller handle.

Clubs can be made of any sufficiently heavy material of the right shape, including woods, metal, stone, or bone, any of which may or may not be carved.

Compared to maces, clubs have their weight distributed along their length. This allows them to be effective at shorter ranges, with shorter windup, and be better for blocking or bracing, but less capable of shattering targets.

As a weapon, they are normally carried as a non-lethal deterrent, but can still inflict lethal wounds with enough blows with strong enough force.

Clubs are [[SIMPLE WEAPON]], and can easily be [[IMPROVISED]] with any sufficiently heavy object, including branches and logs, large enough bones, or metal rods.
