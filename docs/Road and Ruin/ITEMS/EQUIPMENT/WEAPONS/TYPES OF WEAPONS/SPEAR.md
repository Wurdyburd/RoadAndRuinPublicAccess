'Spears' refer to an item style, where a small blade is affixed to the end of a long length of wood or metal.

The blade:
- Usually made of metal, but can be made of sharpened wood, stone, bone, or glass, or even simply sharpening the end of the handle
- Is more designed for piercing thrusts rather than for slicing
- Can be [[IMPROVISED]] with anything suitable to be [[DAGGER]]

The handle:
- Usually made of wood, but can be any suitably long and sturdy rod
- Often range from 6-8', or 1-1.5x the body height

The main intention of spears is to be capable of striking a target at a further, safer distance. This feature allows it to be used defensively, as a deterrent, strike, and either injure, maim, or kill a target to closes the distance, or be able to strike through smaller spaces such as cracks or windows.

Spears can be defined as [[SIMPLE WEAPONS]], but given their combat advantages, many advanced techniques have been developed that require [[POLEARM USE]] proficiency.

They can be wielded in one hand, often accompanied by a [[SHIELD]], either as a loose skirmishing fighter, or organized into rank and file rows with other similarly-armed fighters.
They can also be wielded with both hands, which increases the thrusting power and accuracy of an attack, as well as resistance should an aggressor charge at the spear user, but with a slight loss of range.

Spears are often evenly balanced, but may actually be weighted further down the shaft, in order to better rotate the spear and aim it's tip faster and more precisely.

Spears can be thrown, but without head-distribution weighting, will lack power.

Spears lack effectiveness inside their held range, but can be turned sideways in an attempt to shove.
