Equipment simply refers to items that are designed to facilitate an outcome.

- [[WEAPON]]S are objects with sharpened points or edges, or heavy weights, constructed to inflict damage.
- [[ARMOR]] are durable materials worn on the body to help protect from outside threats, while [[SHIELD]]S are barriers carried and held to keep outside threats at a distance in a specific direction.
- [[ARTIFACT]]S are devices that either enable or improve the casting of spells.
- [[TOOL]]S are items designed to either make a task easier, or to enable a task impossible via bare hands.
- [[CONSUMABLE]]S are resources used to keep both items and creatures in good working order.
