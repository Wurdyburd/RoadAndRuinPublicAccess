Artifacts refer to devices that have been crafted explicitly for the channeling or storage of magic. While a spellcaster may be capable of casting magic without such a catalyst, using one gives them significantly amplified abilities at best, and can act as a placebo even at worst. These make them effective as a spellcasting [[METHOD]].

The most common use-varieties of artifact are:
- [[WAND]]. These devices are often short, held in one hand, and are easily concealed or stowed, and work to amplify [[GESTURE]], indicating targets at short- to medium-range.
- [[STAFF]]. These long rods are as much a badge of office as a tool, for how obvious they are at a distance. Held in one hand or two, they amplify large-radius effects, or accuracy of long-range magic.
- [[TRINKET]]. These can be just about anything, but are usually small, and affixed by rings, necklaces, or bindings, and draw upon the user's sympathetic associations through emotional or motivational origins. They typically amplify very short-range magic, especially magic that targets the user themselves.
