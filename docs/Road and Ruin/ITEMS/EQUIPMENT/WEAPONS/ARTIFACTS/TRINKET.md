 Trinkets can be just about anything, but are usually small, and affixed by rings, necklaces, or bindings, and draw upon the user's sympathetic associations through emotional or motivational origins. They typically amplify very short-range magic, especially magic that targets the user themselves.

Trinkets may be objects activated through faith, but manipulating the higher functions of one engineered through sorcery may require [[TRINKET USE]] proficiency.

Example Trinkets:
- Pendants or rings, jewelery
- Bones, skulls, or teeth or preserved eyes
- Holy relics
- Runes, painted or through ritual scarring
- Preserved plants
- Crystals and gems
