Staffs are long rods that are as much a badge of office as a tool, for how obvious they are at a distance. Held in one hand or two, they amplify large-radius effects, or accuracy of long-range magic.

While many spellcasters carry a long stick for a variety of uses, [[STAFF USE]] proficiency may be required to unlock a powerful staff's higher functions.
