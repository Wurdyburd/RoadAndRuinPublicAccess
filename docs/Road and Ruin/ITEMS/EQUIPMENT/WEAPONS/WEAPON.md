Weapons are any objects with sharpened points or edges, or heavy weights, constructed to inflict damage.

While called by name, many weapons have [[TECHNIQUE]]S that require specific components, weighting, or shapes, referred to as a [[STYLE]], and may require [[WEAPON PROFICIENCY]] or [[DISCIPLINE]] to use effectively.
[[IMPROVISED WEAPON USE]] applies these styles to best decide what techniques are allowed, and what kind of damage is possible.

- [[SIMPLE WEAPON]]: Only requires basic know-how to use, are the most commonly found, and have fewer [[TECHNIQUE]]s.

### WEAPON MODIFIERS
-SERRATED: Slashing attacks suffers a To Hit penalty, but inflicts Bleeding on Special
-ARMOR PIERCING: A piercing-dominant weapon is one size larger for STR requirement and piercing damage; if Special, ignores an amount of armor equal to the weapon's damage
-HEAVY: Considered one size larger in weight, causing them to be harder to swing, travel less far, and deal more damage
-REACH: Considered one size larger in size, but not weight, affecting distant spaces, having first strike, but not dealing as much damage
### WEAPON DAMAGE
-Humans are Size 3, Size is 0.5m spans
-Weapons inflict damage equal to their Weight
-Weight is equal to Size, +1 for Heavy, -1 for light
-Weapons of equal size require +1STR or 2H to use properly

### CALCULATING A WEAPON'S STATS
-Spear: It's big, like "size of you" big, so as a human Size 3, that makes it Size 3
-Damage: It's a thrusting weapon, so d4 Piercing
-It's Size 3 so it deals 3 damage, but it's above half your own Size, so it requires 2H or higher strength
-Make it lighter, you can 1H it now, reduces it's weight and damage by one stage, as though Size 2
-The Spear does 2 damage on a d4 Piercing attack, with Reach
-As a goblin, Size 2, the same math shifts it down by one, So 1 damage on a d4 Piercing attack, Reach between goblins but not against humans
