#### MISC
- BEASTKIND: Choose one animal trait. You gain either increased command of creatures who make use of that trait, increased skill at manifesting that trait, or increased skill at harvesting and crafting with items of that trait.
- RTM: ETCH FLESH: You gain the ability to treat organic materials, and align their magical energies to form a lattice, not unlike an artifact. This allows you to not only more easily enchant a target, but to cause that enchantment to persist quasi-permanently.
- STAMPEDE: You spook or motivate all animals within a small grouping to leave the area, gaining the Stampede intention. Linking to, favoring, or travelling as part of the group allows for you to control their direction, speed, and stopping location.
- GROUPTHINK/MOB MENTALITY: Thoughts gain Contagion. Creatures within proximity to the target gain the same intention. Creatures who do not share belief in the intention are rendered confused. At a higher level and for a mana stone cluster, you may temporarily alter the mob's beliefs as well.
- GROWING PAINS: Creatures and objects may be created in or begin growing in a space half as large as their final size. The creature's Strength, Durability, and Size in excess of the space it's growing deals one durability damage to the holding space, and one durability and health damage to the creature or object.
- ARCANE ARSENAL: AMPLIFY FORCE. Spend energy to amplify the effects of force in the moment of contact.
- LIGHTNING ROD: Either you or a target you are linked to and concentrate on becomes an anchor point 
- NIMBLE FINGERS: Ready-grab inventory, more of your inventory can be sorted as quick-access
- RESTORATION/GREATER: Reverse the impact of negative effects, such as soiling, damage, disease, poisons, and decay. Greater Restoration multiplies the effects, and at upper levels, adds 'curses' and 'aging' to the list of effects. This spell restores a target to it's highest-quality natural state, but cannot renew or replicate enchantments or blessings or exterior effects such as binding, and while it may repair a body, it cannot cause a dead target to become alive again.
- KEEPERS: Adherents of Light may enchant light sources to never go out, or create lights while they concentrate, as a miracle. Adherents of the Sun may emulate sunlight, but only from a single-direction or single-point light source at a time. Adherents of the Stars may emulate as many light sources as they wish, but only to Glow level. Adherents of the Dark retain their ability to see in darkness. Adherents of the Flame, or other elements, may cause an elemental state to persist, for as long as it's state (burning, freezing, windy, etc) doesn't cause exterior changes.

- EXPLORATION - INTERIORS. Types of ROOMS are connected via PASSAGES. The layout of the complex is determined by Origin, and Purpose, and each Interior may have different numbers and types of entry points, or adjoin or combine with other types of interiors, from geological, erosion, volcanic, crystalline, prospecting, travel, occupation, cadaverous, or magical means, but always through either excavation of soft or removable material, like stone and soft earth, ice, wood, or other organic masses, or the construction of free-standing or leaning architecture.
	- GEOLOGICAL - "Caves of force", PASSAGEs and ROOMs are formed from the shifting of the earth, cracking fissures and grinding of stone or ice, or the collapse of heavier material as the earth beneath it is removed and forming gaps. May range from the smallest of fractures and crawlspaces, to enormous craggy excavations. Not typically friendly to traversal, and potentially unstable. Those with flowing water or sufficient air flow may also house various species of plants, birds, and animals, which may prove exotic based on remoteness from the surface.
	- EROSION - PASSAGEs form from the dissolving of mineral material, often through pre-existing cracks, as it carries the material away. Underground rivers are large, constant flows like this, but may not be large enough to traverse, or have breathable air, and may simply travel straight down into underground aquafers. ROOMs are developed from the long-term erosion of large amounts of material, either from downward or upward seepage, the accumulation of moisture from the outside on the cool walls, or sideways lapping of a large body of water, and may have opened a drainage passage leaving the space mostly empty, or continue to be flooded. Water may be toxic and hazardous, and deceptively deep or swift.
	- VOLCANIC - Formed from the flow of high-pressure molten rock in the thousands of degrees, as it forms PASSAGEs through paths of least resistance, ROOMs are created by the pooling of magma, before the pressure lessens elsewhere enough for the flow to move in that direction. On the surface, exposed magma may cool, forming a roof under which magma continues to flow and carve tunnels. Vents leading to the surface are often at an angle, though vertical shafts may also occur.
	- CRYSTALLINE - Though typically a mineral vein or formed inside an existing chamber, different forms of crystal, particularly magical ones, may eat away at other stone and mineral deposits, forming PASSAGEs and ROOMs made entirely from enormous crystal. Such crystals may have other latent properties, or be hazardous in some way.
	- PROSPECTING - Mines are the works of intelligent creatures that aim to excavate earth, usually exclusively to extract natural ore formations to another location for processing. PASSAGES are formed by tunnels and shafts to either traverse or extract material, chimneys to exchange air with the surface, or drainage to redirect water. These may be reinforced with structures, but become unstable over time and age. ROOMs are usually only formed from hollowed-out material deposits, but can be used to store supplies afterward, as offices, or to process the material.
	- TRAVEL - Removal of material to connect two exterior entry points by a tunnel. Usually to save time, effort, or resources on regularly recurring journeys, but also to avoid more dangerous outdoor paths. Often as straight as possible for these reasons, of as easy-to-excavate material as possible, and reinforced with support structures, though excavating solid rock may also occur if there are no alternatives.
	- OCCUPATION - Burrows are ROOMs excavated from the earth solely for the sake of creatures to live and shelter in. Tunnels are PASSAGEs dug to connect burrows, which may separate rooms of different purposes. Both intelligent species and animals may produce these structures, though the purposes and complexities of these structures differ from creature to creature. Usually made from soft earth that can be removed with claws, rakes, or acid, such as by badgers, worms, and ants, though solid rock may also be excavated if necessary. Non-excavated structures are typically constructed as free-standing or leaning buildings, of wooden supports, excavated stone, and mortar, and may be designed for defense. 
	- CADAVEROUS - In rare circumstances, a structure of flesh may be discovered, cavernous spaces made from a ribcage, skull, or shell of an enormous creature, or even a space so extreme as to have tunnels made of blood vessels and chimney passages connected to working lungs. Such places are often extremely hazardous, but follow a layout logic of purpose, of processing and delivery of resources for the sake of keeping the space alive, or based on now-excavated spaces of a place that is now dead.
	- MAGICAL - Different forms of chaotic energy may have an influence on the development of underground areas. Leylines, or the 'veins of venus', formed from the passage of Venusian planar energy, may result in the rapid expansion or contraction of an underground space, or warping minerals, water, and forms of life along the way, leading to terrafers that, while habitable, are among the most complex and unstable places in the world. Magic of the Labyrinth, left unchecked, will continue to unfold new spaces as per the designs of it's Architect, thus resulting in rooms and passages of a certain guided chaos. As well, pocket dimensions can be considered a form of interior space, though typically only accessible through a single portal, and the interior can resemble any variety of space, including outdoors or even non-physical.
- EXPLORATION - ROOMS. Rooms are typically open yet largely-enclosed spaces, encircled by walls or structures, and often denote a STAGE all by themselves. Rooms are usually defined by a single Purpose property, though some may have more than one, which may or may not be related to it's Origin. Example room purposes include habitation, storage, conference, offices, labor stations, training, and recreation.
- EXPLORATION - PASSAGES. Passages often connect Rooms to each other or to exterior space, though in some cases a Passage may be considered a Room or Stage all by itself, and may include paths, roads, tunnels, or even bridges. Passages that connect to other passages as an INTERSECTION or change direction at an angle enough that the walls become an obstacle are considered a CORNER. Where leaving to the sides of the passage is impossible or inconvenient, closed PORTALs may act as obstacles. Example passage purposes include bypass, room connection, funneling, or regular or repeat transportation of people, creatures, materials, or substances.
- EXPLORATION - PORTALS. Portals act as entry points for rooms and passages for either creatures, air, or light and viewing, or may be placed in a WALL to grant limited or even one-way access from one side of the wall to the other, often for safety and defense or privacy. Portals large enough to be intended for convenience of travel may have a DOOR, and even a GATE designed to prevent passage without permission of entry.
- EXPLORATION - WALLS. Walls, simply, are designed to prevent or discourage passage, or to act as an obstacle against sight or projectiles. Walls may be exterior, as free-standing or leaning structures, or interior, defining the boundaries of a Room or Passage, and constitute the makeup of a CORNER. Walls that mark a boundary but are traversable, such as a line of trees or cloud of mist, still present obstacle in the form of line-of-sight or light cover. When closed, DOORs and GATEs may be considered to be a variety of Wall.

#### MECHANICS
- Disease: Having been struck with a disease attack, mark it on your character sheet. After 24hrs, or when you next Long Rest, make an Endurance saving throw against each of the disease inflictions, to see if they stick. Disease inflictions can be cleaned and tended to before this.
- Breath Weapon: Breath, spit, and vomit are an area effect attack, with a To Hit defined as Spit (d4), Drench (d8), Deluge (d12), and Submerged. Affected by armor coverage.
- Wrong, "Coverage" x "Range" indicates the regular To Hit die. Closer and more liquid, the higher the To Hit. Example: Lots of acid, but short range, is a d10/d12, but if it's being launched Nearby, it drops to a d6.
- Proficiency: Zero to five points are represented by (Inept), Common Sense, Introduced, Practiced, Professional, and Specialist. Having 'trained', grants you an extra +0.5 proficiency, allowing you to 'round up' in simple situations, and win in a tie against others of your skill level.
- Knack:
- CONCEPT: Attributes, 1-5, represent the five dice types, and success is on multiples of a 10. Monstrous multiplies the die result by x2-5. "At a cost" is if you roll half the target number.
- COMBAT CR: A general combat skill has a value of +1. Healing +0.5, AOE/multitarget +1.5, Debuff +0.5
- PROFICIENCY EXAMPLE: Attempting to climb down a well and dig into the side to open up a passage. ATHLETICS 3, to reduce strain, BALANCE 2 to maintain orientation, arguably DRIFT for mid-air dangles, or HAULING for carrying your own weight. A character with only ATH 3 and BAL 1 struggles by a point, shifting Success from 7 to 8. If they secured themselves to the rope, rolling a Failure would save them, but damage their equipment and increase the chance of equipment failure in the future.
- CONCEPT: Power attributes like Strength, Intelligence, and Will indicate the range of "Succeed at a cost" allowed. Relying on it ends up costing repeatedly, causing burnout.
- MACHINERY SUFFERS MENTAL/SPIRIT EXHAUSTION FROM OVERHEAT. Soft defeat status.
- Undead tend to lack an attribute category, or specific attributes. Which attributes or categories they're missing can denote their type. Zombies tend to lack all spirit attributes, INT, and FOC, while maintaining a low amount of Wits. Ghosts lack physical attributes, and anywhere from 1-5 of the

	- Translation: This class has a component that allows it to treat one keyword or theme, as a different, potentially completely unrelated keyword or theme. For instance, "Scribing > Blood", letting a scribe cast enchantments normally requiring written word into the blood of a person, and use blood instead of ink
	- Sacrifice: This class gives up some of it's effectiveness in one area, to improve effectiveness in another area, to a maximum of one-octave higher than what the creature's species or circumstances might ordinarily allow. For example, a lich becomes undead, and gets enormous penalties to use of Physical attributes, and a Social belief change to reflect their new sociopathic nature
- PAY: You may attempt to use your skills to earn money.
	- Base: 1d4 coin per day
	- Danger Pay: Find the average, on a scale of 1-5 likelyhood that you encounter a danger, plus 1-5 level of lethality, combined and divided by 2
	- Experience: Required proficiency of Familiarity (+1), Practice (+3), and Professionalism (+6), while Specialist doubles each value
	- Demand: Add or subtract 1-5 based on how urgent or saturated the market is for the job
	- Crafts: Expected time of about 1 Size (1.5ft) of product per day for basic works, and exponentially more time per level of precision or quality; Rolled on the Mastercrafts d100 table each time, which may cause production failures
- So a town guard: 1d4 + (1+3)/2, for a low likelyhood but solid lethality, or +2, + 1 familiarity, person has to seem trustworthy,+ 1 demand, it's a necessary job but not super important, = 5-8 coins per day, with an expected rate of 1 coin per meal and 1-2 coins per day rent, means you might be saving some money but for the most part are just getting by

#### CONCEPT: Violent Violence
How fast can we make combat feel?
-Throw a die and try to get a number over the target's Toughness
-If it's over, you deal 1x damage. Deal 2x damage if it's twice as much
-If the target chooses to spend their die this turn to Block, they also roll a die, and the incoming attack must get a value in excess of their Block value
-Choosing to Exert, gains more dice; to either make Strong Attacks (taking the one highest result), Multiple Attacks, Defensive Offense, or Bunker

#### CONCEPT: Mixed Roles
Is there a possibility of combining roles? How might different roles contribute, outside their primary mechanics?

#### CONCEPT: Cunning/Agile/Mighty/Defend
This concept bothers the shit out of me and while it's really good I don't think it's good for anything other than combat maneuvers.
MOVES:
- PREEMPTIVE (INT+

#### CONCEPT: Conviction
Characters measure their Beliefs in a value of Conviction. The basic principles:
- Having a high amount of conviction in a Belief grants advantages to Will, Poise, and Focus, representing a distinct interest or demonstration of confidence and faith.
- Failing a Connection+Deception saving throw may create a new belief, up to half the belief it stems from. The new belief makes full use of the power of it's parent Conviction, unless the deception is unraveled, and becomes a Doubt.
- Scenarios and experiences that appeal to one or more beliefs constitutes an Urge. Roll a d10; if your result is lower than your Conviction, you feel the Urge to become involved. You may roll a saving throw, to increase the result in a bid to restrain yourself, based on the amount of social exertion expended.
- Choosing not to become involved, or acting directly contrary to an existing belief, damages that belief's Conviction score by 1 or 2 points. Manipulation may also damage Conviction, while actions confirmations of faith and belief are given the opportunity to increase Conviction by a point.
- A belief that has been recently damaged, or has been damaged below half it's full conviction level, manifests a Doubt. Suffer a penalty to initiative and reaction time whenever in the presence of a source of doubt. Actions taken in the presence of doubt, but not directly associated with it, may socially exert to put aside such thoughts, and focus on the task at hand.
#### CONCEPT: Obsession and Addiction
An Obsession or Addiction is a belief-based condition that produces an urge of high conviction.
The character loses one maximum SP whenever a number of days equal to a week minus the conviction score have passed without engaging in their obsession or addiction.
If this value exceeds the number of days in a week, it begins halving the number of hours in a day:
- Conviction 7: Once a day
- Conviction 8: Once every 12hrs or twice a day
- Conviction 9: Once every 6hrs or three times a day
- Conviction 10: Once every 3hrs or four times a day
- Conviction 11: Once every 1.5hrs
- Conviction 12: More than once per hour
If a character demonstrates their obsession, they may spend SP to roll one d6 per SP spent. If any die or combination of die would result in the value of their Conviction, they earn a Deed, and escalate their Obsession or Addiction by one value.
#### CONCEPT: Reputation
Reputation can represent multiple different things, but how it manifests, as a gear score, is dependent on the beliefs of others.
- Setting a baseline of reputation with a new social target, roll a die. If they roll below your Reputation, they HAVE heard of you, as a Gossip roll.
- The target number can shift or be modified based on reputation-source niche or distance from the center of that reputation; the inside of a city that you've saved is a big bonus, but a small mountain village will likely have a significant penalty, that'll make it harder for them to have heard of you.
- How far below the target number the dice rolls reveals how MUCH they've heard of you.
- An Outcome roll reveals the character's random overall Beliefs surrounding what they've heard, including how true and embellished it is, as anywhere from a +0, +1, -1, or +/-2 Alignment result. In the most extreme circumstances, even multiplying the impact, especially if the character has a pre-existing belief that aligns or conflicts with your deeds, as an obsessed groupie or professional hater.
- An especially hateful or supportive character may alter your reputation in the local area, improving the Gossip modifier and affecting the Alignment outcome.
- This final value is the amount of Influence you have on the person starting out, granting a positive or negative gear modifier to conversations and negotiations with them.
- If the person discovers new information about you, it's added or subtracted from that Influence score, depending on the character's Beliefs. This can be the result of misinformation as well.
- You may attempt to borrow the Influence of another source, such as a lord or noble, a merchant, or even a supernatural entity like a god, but the amount of Influence is still a result of the target's Beliefs and Conviction.

#### CONCEPT: Quirks
Quirks act as minor modifiers to a character in ways that may be unusual, and will often afford them slight situational advantages, in exchange for situational penalties. Demonstrating a situational penalty grants a Deed.

#### CONCEPT: Conviction as a single sanity bar
- Let's say that 'conviction' is a health pool, of 5 points. Characters begin at 0, can go up to +2, or down to -2. Becoming inspired through a confirmation of their beliefs, or performing their beliefs, can reward a point, or they can spend a point to gain the full value of their 'Aspect' as a bonus to the scenario, but not earn and spend at the same time. Characters who become demoralized, witness an undermining or dismantling of their beliefs, or actively work against their belief in a provable way, either lose a point, or suffer a penalty to the scenario equal to the full value of their aspect, but not both at the same time. (There is no mechanical purpose to "negative" conviction, it's a purely psychological device to represent a demoralized character, but there's room to add a mechanic there.)
- This has multiple effects. Players are encouraged to not only build an aspect because of enormous value in specific situations, while still having the option to turn either an easily-winnable scenario or a roll that their advantage still won't let them succeed into a benefit they can carry forward for later. Players are also discouraged from undermining or violating their aspect, giving the GM AND the player rules-as-written permission to either make the difficulty harder, or spend a point to bypass for morale flexibility. A character can remain either purely good or purely bad, or have more narrative nuance with an occasional vice or an unexpected virtue. Does it have the potential to farm a low-value aspect you wouldn't want to spend points on, for the conviction to later spend on high-value benefits? Sure. Do I ultimately want the characters to succeed at the things they've invested their XP into? Absolutely. The value of a point is equally a potentially major advantage when you want to win, as well as used to bypass the penalties when you want to avoid losing, but it's the player's choice on whether they prioritize flexibility of morality or overachieving in their specialization.

#### CONCEPT: Shoulder Advisors
- Like a devil and an angel, when you want to do something, and state your intended outcome, ask one of the players to your left or right what the best possible effect could be. Then, ask the other what the worst possible outcome would be. These define the Critical Success and Critical Failure terms of your dice roll.

#### CONCEPT: Summary of Conflict
- Civilised (performed when you try to Subdue someone or something), Savage (performed when you try to Break someone or something), Holy (performed when trying to purify something), Nobility of Tharkur (performed when using a weapon or emblem of that noble House), Medea (performed when acting on behalf of the city of Medea)
- If I start spitballing here... Instead, maybe simplify the encounter, in broad strokes, to determine the outcome of the round: rather than allow a player to "make an attack", that "deals 5 Nobility damage", the players pool their resources for each damage type, with the biggest pool going first. These combined resources compete against the opponent's resistance to that damage type, and the SCENARIO takes 'damage', measured in your progress toward that outcome. Each damage type is then pooled and rolled in descending order, until you end the round and do it again, with all the sword-slashing and incanting and what have you kind of muddied in to a generalization of the round, until the scenario's "difficulty level" has taken enough "damage" to be resolved, in the manner that was most predominant. You'd essentially HAVE to have individual resistances here, both from the target opponent and from the scenario itself, to help mix things up a bit, as well as opponent and scenario immunities to certain resolution mechanics where it wouldn't be possible to come out ahead, but it has a lot of potential for diversifying both fights themselves and team compositions.

#### CONCEPT: Racial Traits
- Used to both construct new races, as well as allow for deviation within members of a single race.

| NAME         | EFFECT | COST | GAIN |
| ------------ | ------ | ---- | ---- |
| GIANT        |        |      |      |
| MINI         |        |      |      |
| WINGED       |        |      |      |
| HOLLOW BONES |        |      |      |

#### CONCEPT: Food
- Different foods are classified by different types and qualities.
- -1 - ALLERGIC: Regardless of the quality of the material or it's properties, the character suffers a violent reaction.
- 0 - RAW/IMPROVISED: While many foods can be eaten safely raw, it invites a host of possible diseases or parasites.
- 1 - IMPROVISED/COOKED: A simple process for eliminating basic pathogens without much care for taste.
- 2 - PRESERVATIVES: Food that is safe over long term and maybe even seasoned, it can be travelled with or relied on.
- 3 - PLEASANT: Made fresh and still warm, with a variety of ingredients and spices that requires access to civilization to acquire.
- 4 - EXCELLENT: Requires great skill or talent in the kitchen, using attention to detail and the finest ingredients.
- 5 - LUXURY: Made with difficult to source or exotic ingredients, this refined taste is the realm of either the extremely demanding, or a once in a lifetime opportunity.
- At each stage, a form of mild allergy, disagreement with the creature's digestive system, or layer of aesthetic disgust imparts a -1 to the quality of the meal. In the case of extreme allergy, all quality is lost, and set at -1 value.
- An Outcome roll made every 4 hours dictates whether the food agrees with you. Failure results in proportional amounts of Illness, while Great Failure inflicts a points of damage per octave.
#### CONCEPT: [[Element shit]]
- Assigning themes and categories to elements.

| ELEMENT | Theme                                                             | Other           |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Fire    | Ignition, Propagation, Amplification, CONSUMPTION, PURIFICATION,  | Smoke, Warmth   |
| Water   | PURIFICATION, DIFFUSION, Submersion, EROSION                      | Depth, Pressure |
| Air     | EROSION, DIFFUSION, Ascension,                                    |                 |
| Stone   | Protection                                                        |                 |
| Growth  | Propagation, Amplification                                        |                 |
| Ice     |                                                                   |                 |
| Storm   | Acceleration                                                      |                 |
| Light   | PURIFICATION                                                      |                 |
| Dark    | CONSUMPTION, Corruption, Deception, Seduction                     |                 |
| Time    |                                                                   |                 |
| Chaos   |                                                                   |                 |
#### CONCEPT: Intent and Appeal
Theoretically, characters and creatures are driven by a multitude of possible motivations, even conflicting ones. Alliances happen when those motivations align, and bargains happen when attempting to Appeal to one character's motivation raises that motivation to the level where they're willing to overlook the ways that it'd harm their other motivation.
Characters who enter an encounter, combat or otherwise, are driven by an Intent. There's something they want to achieve, or something they want to prevent. A character attempting to Appeal aims to either :
- Diminish the motivation behind that creature's Intent. This is HARD, and attempts to change that creature on a fundamental level, which may be impossible, especially when motivated by baser instincts.
- Separate themselves from the definitions of the motivation. This involves PERSUASION and/or DECEPTION, depending on the honesty behind the Appeal.
- Distract, amplifying another of the creature's motivations until it eclipses and replaces their current Intent.
- Bargain, by offering a new motivation that effectively resolves one of the creature's motivations, to the point that they're willing to accept the threat to their current Intent.

#### CONCEPT: BRINGING IT ALL TOGETHER
New skill check system.
- When making a check, roll a die to represent your skill in a relevant Attribute and Proficiency to the task, as well as for any Equipment or Enchantments.
- Three or more die must be rolled, so the third value is set as a 1 (A critical failure) unless Equipment, Enchantments, or Exertion contribute a third die.
- (NOTE: Potentially, allow for two relevant proficiencies to be used, as a fill for the third die)
- Values range from 1-5, which are represented by a d4/6/8/10/12.
- Extreme attributes, Specialized proficiency, and Automated Equipment roll two of the same die.
- Enchantments may alter the type of die, the result on a die, or add a new die.
- Monstrous effects may multiply the outcome of the die roll.
- The second-highest die rolled is used to determine success level:
2 - Easy, basically effortless
4 - Might require a slight nudge, better to be familiar with the subject
6 - Requires professional experience and the appropriate tools
8 - Demands specialization and high-quality tools
10 - Requires a lot of work and renowned amounts of skill
12 - Basically divine intervention
CRITS - Each die of a 1 results in a complication, or critical failure. Each 2 value in excess of the target number results in a flourish, or critical success. Failures and successes negate each other.
- By overexerting an attribute, skill, or equipment, it takes a point of damage, which is marked on the sheet. If damage which bring the remaining value into the range of a new die type, that die is rolled for future actions instead. For example, a value-4, or d10 contribution, that takes two points of damage is rolled as a d8.
- Exerting a contribution allows either rolling an additional die of the same type, or increasing the value of the final die selected by +1.
- Some features may allow overexertion to increase the die type of the additional die, or increase the final value of the die by an additional amount.
- Team actions half the total challenge level, and all contributing actors adds any value in excess of the reduced threshold to a pool. If the pool exceeds the original challenge level, it succeeds.
RESTING
- Performing a "Breather" allows you to damage your Stamina, Mana, or Spirit to roll another attribute or proficiency as a skill check, and repair their damage by a number of points equal to the success.
- Becoming "Well Rested" allows you to repair an amount of Stamina, Mana, or Spirit, equal to the quality of your rest.
> EXAMPLE
> A heavy rock lies in the path, the ceiling of this ancient temple caved in during ages past. Analysis indicates that a minimum value of 10 (extreme effort) would be required to even shift it, with every 2 points in excess allowing it to be moved farther and faster, but nobody in the party has the Strength, Hauling proficiency, or other tools that could generate an 8. Working together, as a Team Action, brings the threshold down to 5, and the team of three generate a 4, 5, and 6. Together, their results equal 5+(-1+0+1), or 5. Between the three of them, they would have to exert a total of 5 resources, 6 if there's pressure on the weak link to pull their weight, to get the rock to shift at all.
> Following this, the actors who exerted themselves perform a Breather, damaging their Stamina to attempt to replenish points of Strength, which will have to do as they continue into the ruins.

#### CONCEPT: THE COMBAT SCENE
New combat resolution system.
- During Hastened Time, time slows to a crawl, before it collapses and results cascade. Each actor makes known their Intention, which includes their Objective, Target, and their Method.
- OBJECTIVE may include anything from killing an opponent, to nonlethal subdual, protecting yourself or another target from harm, preventing entry, egress, or interaction, sabotage, or stealth.
- TARGET describes the person, creature, object, or effect that makes up a given event.
- METHOD may mean using different weapons or weapon techniques, other equipment, spells, or a variety of skill checks.
- Each round of Hastened Time is broken up into three general phases:
-PREEMPTIVE ACTION: These include actions taken even before the scenario, as well as actions that can be resolved instantaneously. INSIGHT, PREP, COMMAND, and FIRST STRIKE attacks occur here.
-FAST ACTION: These are actions that can be taken quickly. INFLUENCE, DEFENSE, PROTECTION, REACH, RANGED, SPELL BUILDING, and the majority of basic ATTACKs occur here, in order.
-SLOW ACTION: These actions are cumbersome, weighty, or have a degree of investment. SPELL RESOLUTION stages, MULTIATTACK, HEAVY BLOWS, and CRAFTING effects, in order.
- Each actor has one action each round. To perform an Enhanced Action (doubling the speed or power of an action) or Split Action (performing more than one action), requires exertion.
- In the event of a tie, where multiple actors would have their action resolved in the same round, all actors pool their Objective, Target, and Method votes with their allies. The activity that generates the most likeminded agreement goes first, as does any activity or resources attempting to prevent it.
> For example, if all five City Guards collectively agree to Subdue and Arrest the Adventurers, a Fast Action, and four of the five adventurers want to Escape Capture, which is also a Fast Action, while one wants to Hide from the Guards, a Slow Action, the City Guards will make their move first. They'll have to allocate their resources between the available targets, and will have a much easier time targeting the single adventurer who broke ranks than grappling with the whole of the team combined, but that'll take resources away from the rest of the team. The guards roll their attack against the adventurer's resistances, and mark any successes as Subdual damage.
- ATTACK: Launches an attack against a random target in the opposing subgroup with the weapon currently in hand. Uses the weapon's standard damage die. On any result of a maximum, roll another die of one greater size. Exert to either 0) Make an attack while defending, 1) Roll at a higher size, up to the available profile, 2) Add +1 to the result, up to the available profile, or 3) Make an additional attack roll later in the initiative, at one die size lower than standard, up to a number of times allowed by the profile.
- DAMAGE: "Harm" intention dice that land results greater than the opponent's defense generates one 'harm' success, inflicting a point of damage to the target's health and Steadfast, plus another for every multiple of that defense. (A 7 over 3 is two successes) "Subdue" intention dice only inflict Steadfast damage.
- BATTLE STRESS: A creature who is the target of "Harm" intention still receives one Steadfast damage each round, even if they received no damage.
- SHAKEN/BROKEN: A creature who has their Steadfast depleted becomes Shaken, and must pass a shock test every future round, with any amount of exertion necessary to succeed, in order to avoid falling back.
- DEFEND: Replaces the defender's defense with any higher value rolled on using the defender's standard defense die. Exert to either 0) Attempt to block while attacking, 1) Brace with a shield or significant environmental obstacle, adding it's durability to your armor, or 2) Add +1 to the result.
- FALL BACK: Moves the character to the back row of the group to prioritize.

#### CONCEPT: TRIBAL TYPES
New simplification for tribes.
- Creatures can have a Planar Type and/or a Creature Type, Build, and Blood. Tribes also come with Beliefs or Culture based on their experiences or upbringing.
-PLANARTYPE: Morphology resulting from either planar origin, or planar contamination. In almost all cases, dramatically alters the creature's appearance. May alter Build, but typically at least grants an elemental enhancement, elemental resistance, and elemental vulnerability, as well as a new Belief.
- VENUSIAN: You manifest one (or several) of the traits of primordial nature. ADAPTIVE, CYCLIC, SAVAGE, PROPOGATOR.
- MARTIAN: You manifest one (or several) of the traits of elemental fire. TRANSMUTATOR, INSATIABLE, FURIOUS, ESCALATOR.
- PLUTONIAN: You manifest one (or several) of the traits of stagnant night. BLACKBLOOD, STILL, LUNATIC.
- FAE: Creatures of contradiction, both nascent and ancient, clever chaos and senseless order.
- CELESTIAL: Creatures of astral disposition.
-GENOTYPE: Long-standing genetic history, of an entire species, enough to determine compatible partners for offspring.
- MANN:  The people of man are numerous and varied, but they are sturdy and adaptable. Includes humans, halfings, elves, dwarves, and gnomes.
- DRACON: (-) Cold-blooded reptilian creatures that tell tales of powerful ancestors. Includes dragonborn, kobolds, lizardfolk, tortle, and saurians.
- AVIAN: Feathered and beaked creatures of fragile disposition. Includes kenku and aarakocra, tatzl, and sylphs.
- BARBO: Goblinoid beastfolk with a mysterious shared history. Includes orc, haorg, and goblin.
- FLEUR: Floral fauna and animated arbors. Includes myconids, treants, leshy, and shambling mires.
- MER: Gilled and amphibious creatures who inhabit the coast and rivers, the depths, or half their time between. Includes merfolk, selkies, crabfolk, and skink.
- CH'KIT: Multi-limbed chitinous insectoids with Builds relevant to a hive role or predator species. Includes myrmidons, thri-kreen, wasplords, arachnarids, and mantisblades.
- SPIRIT: Ephemeral entities of various types. Includes elementals, sprites, landvaettir, gods, demons, youkai, and totems.
- CONSTRUCT: Mechanical, alchemical, or enchanted entities driven toward or deviating from a predefined purpose or command. Includes bocci, samiat, homunculi, and simulacrums.
-PHENOTYPE: Also known as Build, these are more comparatively recent adaptations, with alterations to skin and hair color, size, and weight, or a direct transformation. Up to 2 phenotypes.
- IMPLING: Creatures of Small Size. (-) base movement, (3x) base sprint distance, (+) evasion, (-) maximum health. (+) DEX, INT, WIT, FOC, or CON, (-) STR, END, or POI
