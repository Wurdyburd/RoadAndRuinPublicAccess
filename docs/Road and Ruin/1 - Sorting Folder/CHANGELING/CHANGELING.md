## CHAPTERS
Gist: A Halloween ritual is interrupted after the child sacrifice is whisked away by an unseen interloper. On a clock, the party must rescue the boy, whether to finish the ritual or at least from the horrors of the Hedge. The Hedge is raw with Halloween influence on this specific day, and the group must take care not to get lost in the brambles as they encounter strange things, face nefarious characters, retrieve the child, and bring them back to safety, but other, sinister forces may be working in the background.
### 1) Lead up to the ritual, characters are given the chance to formulate their thoughts and reveal anything they may have learned. (22)
- In the late evening, sun setting in a conflagration caged in twisted tree branches, slowly guttering in the horizon as it fades into a deep blue darkness, our group delves into the forest on the outskirts of a familiar city.
- Faint mist flows up over verdant moss not unlike a cloud of spores, swept to the side by the shapes of other figures travelling down the sloping forest path. No one speaks, no one whispers.
- Passing beneath these gnarled limbs, the trees seem to tower tall over you, giving you slight unsettling memories of the Hedge. Ivy-choked specters shift and sway, as though threatening to spring to life and snare you in their thousand-finger grasps, their knotted roots causing you to trip and stumble, and the rot of decaying life assails your nostrils.
- You are called here this day by your freehold's Autumn Court, at the bidding of a travelling witch by the name of Red Wren, who claims to possess a ritual that puts a stop to the kidnapping of children in the area for an entire year and a day. When asked, she reveals the cost to be at the expense of a young child. After much deliberation, the courts defer to the reigning Autumn Court, and so, the ritual is proceeding, here, in these woods.

### 2) Red Wren zealously insists the ritual be performed. Her servant, Henry, appears a tortured prisoner, suffering stockholm syndrome and lovingly doting on his master.
- Clambering over a massive fallen tree, the path broadens into a clearing approx. 20 yards across, ringed with stones, the settling mist glowing in the flickers of a circle of torches. The grass here is dead and matted, and in the center, the Autumn witch herself. Sharp red leaves unfurl from her weathered and practically translucent skin, and her auburn hair almost seems to blow from imagined wind. Her round, black, glossy eyes disguise the target of her gaze, and even looking at her too long gives you the sensation that a flock of birds flaps caws just out of the corner of your eye, though there never is if you turn to look. She moves unusually, from position to position, remaining stock still whenever not in motion, as still as the trees that ring the clearing. Near her hovers a young teenager, of African descent and in simple clothing, tending to any last-minute adjustments, and never travelling far from her orbit.
- The freehold Lost who have gathered here shuffle uncomfortably. Some speak quietly to each other, the occasional glance toward the witch, some seem absolutely furious, stalking the clearing like caged animals.
- Near Red Wren, lying in the grass, is a wooden door in a wooden doorframe, with an ornate metal handle.
#### - CANVASING THE CROWD : 0

- Dramatic: -1 Social with all gathered
- Success: Gauge the court mood, Learn general opinion and mood of three characters
- Exceptional: Above, but Nyx seems particularly on-edge; +1 Social with all gathered
### 3) The ritual begins, and tension is high.
- Red Wren suddenly moves, spreading her leafy arms high and wide, not unlike the branches of a tree. In a booming voice that belies her appearance, she declares: "It is now time for the Children's Contract to be written."
- The crowd quiets, and when any antagonists refuse to do so, nearby Autumn Courtiers move to intimidate them into at least gaining some distance. Red Wren turns to her servant, who hunkers near the door, and who proceeds to knock on it three times, in a rap-tap-tap. Red Wren chants a strange rhyme, spoken, not booming, in a voice who's words are meant only for the door, the sound stolen out of the air: "Let us out, let us in, we eat of fear, who eat of sin." Henry turns the knob, and the door *falls* open, downward and into the ground, amber light shining up through the opening, and tendrils of hedgebriar slithering past the edges. Together, Red Wren and Henry stoop down into the opening, and lift out what appears to be a wooden box. As more of the box emerges, it's length becomes apparent: a pinewood coffin, conspicuously sized for a child, wreathed in coils of dark ivy and black roses.
- The coffin is propped against a nearby table, and the box is pried open, ivy ripping away, to reveal a young boy.
- ##### ! - INTELLIGENCE + OCCULT + AUTUMN MANTLE: Recognize the boy, who has been appearing in dreams, as a child with a briar crown and pitch-black eyes.
- The boy seems almost... tranquil. He shivers in the cold through his thin clothes, but does not blink, only stares vacantly at the scene. Henry reaches in and roughly grabs the boy's arm, pulling him, stumbling, out of the box, into the circle. Wren, reaching into her crimson cloak, produces a long, black thorn, easily a foot long, Hedge magic radiating from it like a torch. "Let the blood of the boy and dreams of the thorns mingle, shades protect him and all like him from the fiends beyond the fence!" She holds the thorn aloft, showing it around to the crowd in a sweeping motion, like a magician preparing to demonstrate a sleight of hand. It reminds you rather callously of a card dealer in Vegas.
##### ! - WITS + COMPOSURE vs JOHN'S (10): Sensing Cancer John
- Success: You smell something... heady, like a whiff of body odor tinged with the smell of decay, like rotting meat and moldering wood. From behind you, you sense motion, a thing unseen quickly moving forward through the crowd toward the circle.
- Exceptional: Above, but gain +1 to any effort to stop him.
##### ! - DEXTERITY + BRAWL (-5): Stopping Cancer John
- Exceptional on Sensing (+1), Character speed of 13 or higher (+1)
- Dramatic: Tackle someone wildly inappropriate, and suffer 1B.
- Success: Cancer John is tackled to the ground, inflicting 1B, but not before Joey is pushed, thrown backward toward the still-open door, and tumbling through.
- Exceptional: Above, but without impacting the boy.
### 4) Chaos erupts, as the freehold tries to decide what to do next.
- In the darkening forest, there hangs but a moment of bated breath. Wren's otherwise unyielding facade shatters, her eyes going wide. She turns to the crowd, and stammers, "I can't go in! I must not leave the ritual space, or the contract will fail!"
##### - Bedlam roars through the crowd.
- ! - Summer courtiers push and snarl, threatening to stream past the Autumn guards and into the circle. Enkidu laughs, a mirthless stout bark. "What's that? You can't be taken out of the circle, or your ritual gets all fucked up? Wouldn't want that to happen!" 
- ##### ! - Ruslan is a billowing cloud, rage etched upon his skeletal face, ranting about stringing up the perpetrator and gutting him like a trout, but lapsing frequently into incoherent babbling about magic and childhood. Ruslan thrusts his putrid face at his Autumn courtiers, rot on his breath and spiders in his teeth, and demands that you do something. Identify the traitor, pursue him, catch him, do anything necessary to advance the ritual. Before you can respond, he's gone again.
- ##### ! - King Queen Jackie Snow steps a foot up upon a stone in a vainglorious pose. "Quickly, Courtiers of Spring!" she keens. "Quickly, into the Hedge! We must retrieve the boy at once, and complete the ritual! For the sake of my nephew, and children everywhere! At once, my loyal subjects!" The Spring Court shuffles and hesitates, and make excuses, and Jackie goes red, frothing with rage.
- Nyx, of the Spring Court, slinks off to the edge of the torchlit clearing to sit upon a log, bouncing her knee in a vision of stress. She bites at her nails, snaps her fingers, chews her lip, and grinds her teeth.
- From behind you, an ice-cool breath bathes the back of your neck, and icicle fingers dance across your shoulders. Morgana, the Winter Flame, seems insatiable in her advances, but something in her proposition almost implies a secret. She acts like she knows something. "Well, THAT was a waste of time. Why don't we both duck this party? Behind a tree is lovely this time of year, quiet, out of sight. I can personally vouch for the privacy."
- At the circle, Lady Miss Pity, accompanied by some attendants, appears a small flower against the imposing countenance of the crimson Red Wren. She seems to be attempting to negotiate with the witch, to call off this failed ritual, but venom-laced biting words from Wren sends the girl scurrying, quickly chased by her consoling entourage.
- Just to the side, stands the rusted soldier, Margrave Doorman. You've heard stories of the man, how he hates the courts, and not to trust him, but he seems sincere. His voice carries no malice, only genuine concern. He seems to want to share something he knows.
##### ! - WITS + INVESTIGATION + EQUIPMENT: Identify the thief. 
- Three clues, with 3 successes each, representing 5 minutes of searching.
- Loud crowd (-1), Distracting figures (-2), Mist (-2), Flashlight +1, Night vision +2, Common Sense +2
