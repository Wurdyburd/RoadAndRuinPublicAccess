After much debate over what kind of experience the core game should have, we can now summarize Road and Ruin as a resource-driven story-pattern character roleplaying game.
- RESOURCES: In order to curb directionless decision-making and slow the turning radius of player agency over plots, the game should prioritize balance that's *just* below that of fairness, with the ability to expend resources to bring probabilities back up into and beyond fairness. Urged to rest, pursue other activities, or go gathering resources in order to try again, tasks become something to overcome, rather than fly past.
- STORY PATTERNS: Both establishing recognizable narrative patterns and defining the ways that those players can manipulate those patterns is

Right. So, what is it that Road and Ruin is exactly trying to be?
A roleplaying storytelling game, is the general answer, but there's lots of those. What is this project aiming to accomplish and be?
- Essentially, a more cohesive, structurally recognizable storytelling game system than what I've seen of other products. Gamifying storytelling tropes and genres such that even someone not already familiar with them should be able to play them, also means that those who ARE familiar with them can reliably add their own spin on it.
- An independent system, that runs on player interpretation. Done well, this should mean that it's even playable solo, without a host-player, but at the very least, the instructional manuals for a host player should be in much better hands than in many other games.
- A game that recognizes and respects risk and consequence. More than that, using the concept of Sequence to link events together, but in a way that a player will recognize when and how their choices made an impact in the long run, 
- If possible, keep everything as short and direct as we can. That means shorter combats, scene-based exploration and events, chapters that can be completed inside an hour and scenes in ten minutes at a time.
- The trick with the above at least is that many people, self included, like to think tactically, and make creative use of available elements, but without being prompted by an existing element, it can be hard to come up with one, and can even feel bad if coming up with something specific to take advantage of. To that end, there needs to be some kind of prompt-based element system, where a player who comes up with an idea can still trust the game to confirm, or deny, whether their 'guess' is actually true.

#### MECHANICAL ELEMENTS
Though the bare minimum of the game involves naught but interpreting elements and generating elements to confirm/deny interpretations, there are a few "core mechanics" that should be recognized by players.

###### DICE MECHANICS
- OUTCOME: Rolling 3d10 and taking the middle, and checking against a d10-based, 50/50 spectrum, separated into intervals of BAD AND, BAD, INSIGHT/COST, GOOD, and GOOD AND, shifted up or down via situational variables. Used to quickly generate unexpected situational modifiers and helping to direct the narrative, especially in fast-paced, exciting scenes, the center-leaning result allows for Exertion to push toward narrow victories, but at an ever-building cost.
- ACCUMULATE: Generating successes by rolling Xd10 and adding to a flat value based on proficiency, Accumulate is a slower-paced system used for slower-paced scenes or complicated, multi-step actions. Value can accumulate via multiple rounds, or multiple helpers, and each resulting multiple of 10, or a success, contributes to greater progress.
- MAKEBREAK: A die of any type, though typically a d10, d20, or d100, contributing factors reduce a threshold down from max value, in the hopes of rolling over. Typically, a counter-value eats from the bottom-up. This "timer"-like system means that, eventually, either victory will be secured, or failure will be met, though the exact amount of time is random.
- DECAY: A card-based system, whereby cards are distributed, and, on pain of consequence, cards are revealed one at a time until a condition is met. This obfuscates the exact nature of the remaining pool, consequences becoming gambles with no assurance of survival. Recommended as a core fixture of a shorter campaign, such as Movie Monster, so that the cards don't become to burdensome.
