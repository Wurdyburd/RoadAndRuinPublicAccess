#### **> CONCEPTS:**
##### **>>> PRED TRAITS:**
GENERAL
- PRED: HERCULIAN HUNGER - Physical actions performed on/against captured or consumed prey are done so at one greater magnitude than normal.
- PRED: HUNGRY HORROR - Physical and social actions taken in pursuit of prey are performed at one greater magnitude than normal if specialized or a Pure Pred while experiencing Adrenaline. 
- FLEX: EAGER EYE/ALWAYS AWARE - Gain a specialization in a perception of choice, as a biological enhancement, including heat, vibration, emotion or thought.
- FLEX: LEARN FROM NATURE - Gain a specialization in imitation of a notable predator or prey mechanism. This may be/may be required to be reflected physically, as a biological enhancement. Includes scent tracking, ambush hunting, webbing, night vision, extreme sprinting, camouflage, lures, claws or teeth, scales, or gills.
- PRED: DANGLE LURE - Something about you is rendered irresistibly alluring, as a biological glamour effect. Gain a method, in the form of specialization, that draws others to you, such as scents or pheromones, an attractive appearance, or even a literal glow. This may be a passive effect, or fine tuned to attract specific types of people, or even a specific individual.
- PRED: MAINTAINED DENSITY - Your extra biomass and fat creates an absorption pad that helps you shrug off blows. You gain extra armor against Bashing damage equal to half your fat.
SWALLOW
- PRED: LOCKJAW - Your teeth and bite carry powerful force, and once you latch on, you don't let go. Gain proficiency in Natural Weapon Use, and increase the damage of your Bite attack.
- PRED: SALIVATE - You produce excess saliva when hungry, granting a bonus to efforts to swallow.
- PRED: UNHINGED - Your jaw can stretch, allowing for the swallowing of much thicker objects. Costs Exertion without specialization.
- PRED: DISCOMBOBULEATEN - Spell, Translocation. You may attempt magic to relocate an object or creature to the confines of your stomach, bypassing your Maw capabilities. Costs +1MP as an augment for any translocation spell, Consume effect, or evokes a maw or teeth. The Distracted status on each active party in swallowing acts as an equipment bonus, increasing the chances of Great Success.
- PRED: UNORTHODOX INTAKE - Choose your method of predation, from Oral Vore, Cock Vore, Anal Vore, Breast Vore, Soul Vore, Thought Vore, or Annihilation. Different methods may require different techniques and proficiencies, and several skills and traits may no longer prove relevant.
STRUGGLE
- PRED: ELASTICITY - Your maximum belly capacity can stretch to be much larger than it's resting state. This can allow for multiple prey, inflation and extra air, and reduction in the impact of Struggling.
- PRED: ONE WAY TRIP - Your esophagus develops a check valve that makes it much more difficult to find the way back up than down.
- PRED: ONE AND DONE - Material your stomach is capable of digesting may have their durability set to match a less durable material, so as to digest the entirety of it's contents simultaneously.
- PRED: THUNDEROUS BELCH - When you belch air and reduce your Current Capacity, you may opt to expel all available air at once. You may choose to eject undigestables, or materials of a durability higher than a set value, of an amount equal in mass to the amount of air expelled or less. This may render those near you Distracted in surprise.
- PRED: ACID AQUAFER - Your belly produces extra acid, increasing the Coverage of objects inside, as well as objects you vomit onto.
- PRED: PROJECTILE VOMITING - You may voluntarily expel acid or any undigested material in your stomach to a space in front of you. This may be performed as an attack, and may vacate your Capacity for further use.
- PRED: HOLLOW HUNGER - Your stomach has the capability of reducing Acid coverage, reducing Acid acidity, and maintaining an amount of breathable air at will.
- PRED: OBSCURING OBESITY - Your excess fat grants a +1 equipment bonus per level to efforts to disguise its current occupant.
- PRED: ADRENAL BOIL - While you have the Adrenaline effect, or any turn you spend exertion points, you may accelerate the effects of acid in your stomach from a per-hour basis, to a per-minute basis. Spending double the exertion accelerates this rate further, to a per-round basis (3 seconds).
RETAIN
- PRED: CLIMBING THE CHAIN/AMASS - As you consume, you work your body into ever more capable form. When you finish with prey, you may roll a Masterwork roll, contributing the difference in skill between you and your prey, and, if successful, gain a permanent +1 specialization in one element of pred activity.
- PRED: WEIGHT WATCHING - Rather than commit digested prey to fat, you may instead convert their mass to exertion points. As a Pure Pred, you may retain excess points as temporary points, up to an amount equal to those gained from your last meal. New prey do not increase the amount of temporary points.
- PRED: ABSORB ESSENCE - As you digest prey, you may choose to glean their mana as your own. As a Pure Pred, you may also opt to store their essence, and emulate it, potentially for spells and spell-like effects.
- PRED: MASS (MIS)MANAGEMENT - Rather than exclusively fat, biomass you digest may be committed to increasing any part of the body. Unless specialized or through another fleshshaping method, each point of would-be fat may be committed in a random place, and a random amount, as a Knack.
- PRED: FAST METABOLISM - Fat and muscle seems to melt off of you no matter how much you try to put and keep it on.
- PRED: WITCH'S CAULDRON - Your stomach contents gain the alchemical properties of your choosing, over the course of 1hr of concentration.
- PRED: HOLLOW HALLS - At any point, you may commit the contents of your stomach to an alternative, magical space associated with you. The rules for escaping this space are a magnitude higher than your normal stomach, though the exact mechanics and method for doing so likely differs.
- PRED: CONSUME THOUGHT - As a gleaning technique, you may attempt to learn information that your prey knew, or was thinking about around the time of consumption. You may also glean mana or details from the thoughts of non-consumed creatures, inflicting them with the Fugue condition while they recover.
- PRED: MUTATION DRIVER - Rather than fat, biomass you digest may be spent to activate Form transformations.
- PRED: DOPPELHUNGAR - Having consumed and processed prey, you may attempt to reform the prey. The creature may range anywhere from being a perfect carbon copy of itself, in any state of wear, or possess any number of traits more reminiscent of you, including race, Form, essence, or up to half of your predatory skill.
##### **>>> PREY TRAITS:**
GENERAL
- PREY: DIRECT DETECTION - You gain the ability to command others' awareness of you. Gain specialization in either avoiding notice, or increasing your attractiveness.
SWALLOW
- ?
STRUGGLE
- ?
RETAIN
- PREY: CONSUMED CARAPACE - While within a creature, you may attempt to hijack it's body, and direct it to say, and do, what you want it to.
- PREY: INVERSE ABSORPTION - While within a creature, you may attempt to digest it from the inside, melding your consciousness with theirs, and assuming their identity. This action is subject to the normal rules for magnitude scaling, making conquering larger, more powerful creatures extremely difficult. Once merged, your new form may retain any measure of resemblance between you and your would-be predator. If you perform this action multiple times, each predator may only lose resemblance, though you may always maintain your own.

#### **EXAMPLE**
-Scenario: Adult male human in an alleyway, Shiv up a fire escape, Far
-Shiv begins her approach, stealthily. The man's currently Unaware, with only Common Perception, so we treat the situation as a baseline 0 event. If we assume practiced stealth, Shiv has a +2, and if she's trying to use the fire escape to maintain stealth on her approach, she'd need at least practiced Athletics, which she has. This gives her a +3 equipment bonus for being directly overhead instead, but doesn't eliminate the chance of Great Failure. Her final Outcome: 2-Up Success, 7-Up Great Success.
-1 9 10 results a 9, or Great Success on the stealth, allowing her free movement of the area undetected so long as no new observers interfere.
-Shiv, Size 3, uses her position to launch a sneak attack, Blindsiding for specialization, and use the drop for an advantage on swallowing the man, headfirst and from behind.
-Initiative: Shiv takes the edge by at least an entire round, inflicting Distracted10. She moves to Swallow, which has a shift of at least +(2x 4) for the difference in Ideal Size, and causes her to exert 2 to stretch her jaw wide enough to engulf the man's shoulders. The man's Distracted Struggle suffers from a magnitude's difference in strength, and -3 Entrapment, for -8, or success on a 14-up, so even a roll of 9 9 9 isn't enough to save them, resulting in a Struggle value of -5.
>-NEED TO REDESIGN THAT

-Shiv's Swallow maneuver thus suffers from +8-5, +1 equipment bonus from Salivate, and an initial +3 for using her weight vertically, for final value of -1 difficulty, or 5-up. She rolls 2 3 8, and chooses to Exert2 of 8 to get  the first Size of 4 in.
-Round 2, the man still suffers from Distracted 5, and nets a 3 4 8, or Struggle -11. Shiv no longer has the weight advantage, but 8 -10-1 still nets a -4 difficulty, or 2-up, with two successes on a 7-up, which she narrowly gains with a roll of 4 7 10. Tipping the man over backwards, she pulls the next almost three feet of the man's torso down her gullet, leaving just the lower legs kicking past her toothy maw.
-Her petite stomach, so close to her mouth, is immediately filled, distending outwards with new capacity as the man's head and arms are unceremoniously shoved in.
-Round 3, the man still suffers from Distracted 2, but Shiv's speed would still outclass that. Need to work on initiative rules. The man Struggles and nets a 3 7 8, or Struggle -11, giving Shiv a 2-up/6-up, and though with only one success with a 3 5 10, slides the last of the main down her throat to join the rest.

-Shiv's maximum elastic capacity is still far in excess of this, and so doesn't present a foothold to try to climb back out, and her One Way Trip feat imposes a -3 gear score penalty on efforts to escape. She lets loose a Thunderous Belch, eliminating the four capacity of air from her stomach, loose objects like glasses or shoes tossed down the alleyway, and her Acidic Aquifer achieves 2-Size coverage of her Acidity 9.
-STILL TIME CLOCK: Acid coverage adds +2 to the attack, of a 9-damage attack, using a d10. Lack of air adds +1 cumulatively. Struggles must move one Size at a time up out of the stomach to escape.
-Round 1, 3-up. Rolled a 6, inflicting 9 damage. SF8 absorbs the first blow, robbing the man of his fighting spirit, and who's only just coming out of his shock from the sneak attack. He thrashes and kicks, making an improvised unarmed kick attack, a d12 3dmg. He rolls a 5, for a 1dmg blow, improving his struggles, his Fight or Flight/Cornered offsetting the penalty of his Distracted, for 3down Entrapment, 1up Strength, and 3down from One Way Trip, and 1up damage, or an 10-up success. He nets a 2 4 7, or 6-off, his squirms making visible distensions in Shiv's belly.
-Round 2, 2-up. Rolled a 9, inflicting 9 damage? Instead, deals 1 damage to health, full damage to steadfast. Clothing has some holes burned in it now, and etching damage has appeared on even metals such as the man's watch and phone. The man has 3/4hp left, but Distracted 1 again from lack of air.  He kicks again, rolling a 6-1, for a 1dmg blow, reducing Shiv to 7/9SF, and struggles again, for an 11-up success with the lower result. He nets 6 6 9, or 5-off, the cramped confines of the lizard's stomach failing to react to his efforts, while a partially-exhausted Shiv soothes her jaw and distended bloat.
-Round 3, 1-up. Rolled a 6, inflicting 1dmg to health, 2/4hp, Distracted 2. The man's kick rolls 6-2, for 1dmg, or 6/9SF, and struggles for 12-up success with a 1 9 3, or Great Failure. The man's thrashing has dispersed the acids in the already-constrained belly, increasing coverage to +3. Shiv has used a moment to recover a point of exertion, and is now groaning idly, punctuated by the occasional "oof".
-Round 4, -1 up. Rolled a 10, or 1/4hp, Distracted 3. The man's kick nets a 7-3, or 1dmg, for 5/9SF, the 13-up success resulting in a 4, or 9-off.
-Round 5, -2 up. rolled another 10, bringing the man to unconsciousness with 0/4hp. Failed to deliver any miraculous recoveries in the next 5 minutes, rendering the man slain.
-Several Outcome 10s in that period and no 1s would dictate variables on Shiv's side; her position in the alleyway is tucked behind some obstacles, making her difficult to spot by chance at the alley's entrance, and nobody heard the greasy goblin's earlier eructation, leaving her safe to happily gurgle her prey into a slushy stew. An hour in, Shiv rolls onto her belly, groaning, and vomit-belches scraps of clothing and buttons, a belt, and the man's remaining shoe, wallet, watch, and phone onto the pavement, drips of acid hissing into the cool night air. She curls back up around her bloated midsection, and over the next three remaining hours, her limbs become the slightest bit fatter, 1/4.
-Another four hours later, Shiv would wake up, past dawn, sitting up on her now more substantial posterior, a stretch and yawn very ungraciously cascading into another rolling belch. Feeling a bit nauseous on standing up, sliding a sagging belly more than half as tall as she was, Shiv heaves, ejecting several acid-pockmarked bones and a skull, clattering into alleyway detritus for some garbage collector or homeless to find someday. With Herculean strength hoisting her grossly distended gut, Shiv would waddle, humming off down the alleyway to a back street, sloshing with every step.
-Taking a roundabout way back to her dingy apartment, she'd spend the next 8 hours digesting what's left of the puddle in her paunch, her cutoff jean shorts carving deeply into an ass and hips having exploding outward several more inches in every direction, much to her dismay. She'd recovered some of her exertion overnight, but thankfully, wouldn't need to make much of an effort for the next four days at least.

-REVISION: Acid Coverage determines damage, Acidity determines what can be damaged
-Round 1, inflicts d10, 3-up (6+8special, 11/10) for 2SF/8SF, Kick for d12 (5+10special, 15/18) for 1SF/9SF, his squirms making visible distensions in Shiv's belly.
-Round 2, inflicts d10+1, 2-up (9+4special, 11/10) for 4SF/8SF, Kick for d12-1D (5+1special, 6/18) for 2SF/9SF, the cramped confines of the lizard's stomach failing to react to his efforts, while a partially-exhausted Shiv soothes her jaw and distended bloat.
-Round 3, d10+2, 1-up (6+3special, 8/10) for 6SF/8SF, Kick for d12-2D (1GF+3special, No Damage and Coverage +1). Shiv has used a moment to recover a point of exertion, and is now groaning idly, punctuated by the occasional "oof".
-Round 4, d10+4, -1 up (10+2special, 11/10, 9SF damage and loss of Fighting Will. Kick for d12-3D (7+9special, 13/18) for 3SF/9SF
-Round 5, d10+5, -2 up (10+8special, 20/10 and special2), dealing an extra x2x2 damage, or a 12 damage crit, vanishing the man's 4hp thrice over as Shiv pushes into her belly, crushing the man into the acid, with no chance for miraculous escape.
