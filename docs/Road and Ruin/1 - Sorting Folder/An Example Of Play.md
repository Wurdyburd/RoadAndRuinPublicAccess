### CHARACTERS
ARTON BRANDERVELT
Arton is a well-travelled and experienced warrior, who's had an introduction to several of the secrets and dangers that dungeons present, without having spent a lot of time in them yet.
- 2 Dungeoneer Resources, that can be spent on rerolling one die when analyzing or evading secrets and dangerous traps. Arton has an (Introduction), but is not (Experienced).
- 4 Explorer Resources, 2 of which were spent getting to this dungeon. Arton is (Experienced) with most wilderness risks, long-distance hauling, navigation techniques, and different cultures.
- 5 Warrior Resources. Arton has a Knack for the sword, giving him an edge over other (Experienced) Warriors, but not enough to be (Professional). 
- BELIEFS: Arton is somewhat of a stoic realist. He follows and trusts in law, and fights for the good in others, though he knows that in a battle hesitation can mean the difference between life and death. 
- Arton has 3 physical Endurance, 2 mental Focus, and 2 spiritual Poise.
##### FEATURES
Arton may spend a Resource during an activity to roll an additional die, using the second-highest as the new roll, and add +1 to that result.
By 'Exerting', Arton may spend points of Endurance, Focus, or Poise, to reroll any one die, and take the new result. Spending a moment to take a Breather, Arton rolls a ten-sided die, or d10, for each exerted point, and on a 4 or higher, recovers that point. On a 3 or lower, that point is Exhausted until the next time he can get a good night's rest instead.

### DUNGEON SETUP
	Our intrepid hero brushes aside the last of the vines covetously caging a tunnel in the roots of this woodland oak. Ancient, cracked stone steps leading down into the gloom promises that this is no natural burrow.
	Arton Brandervelt is an adventurer. A life travelling and fighting has left him agile on the battlefield and deft with the blade that now rests confidently in his hand, though delving into ruins is a somewhat newer experience for him.

Arton's quest today is determined by three major elements, their minor element, and their posture, as well as the difficulty expected:

| THE PRIZE | THE HEARTH | THE MANY |      Difficulty:       |
| :-------: | :--------: | :------: | :--------------------: |
|   WHERE   |    WHY     |  WHERE   |           7            |
| STANDARD  |  INVERTED  | STANDARD | Confidently Successful |
This region's ruins feature the site of an old coliseum. Tunnels built beneath the ruins would be used for storage of weapons and armor, ferocious beasts, and gladiators, who would fight for the sport of cheering masses, only to return to their shackles belowground. Such days are beyond even a whisper of a breeze behind now, an old-oak forest growing up through the cracks in the foundations, scarcely a wall to be seen beyond the occasional pile of toppled rubble, yet many of the tunnels and chambers still lie beneath this soil, such as this entryway here.

Investigating these sort of ruins often fall to guards and travelling mercenaries, able to defend themselves in the case of attack from wild beasts or lawless folks long enough to chart the ruins, document changes, and retrieve any relics or treasures found there.
### PLAYING THE GAME
There are several play elements making up Road and Ruin, though most of them filter through the Outcome roll. Three ten-sided dice, or 3d10, are rolled, and the result of the second-highest, or middle, result is checked against a table.
- If the action has to do with Dungeon activities, such as traps or secrets, the results move one value easier.
- If the action has to do with Exploration or Combat activities, the results move two values easier.

|                | FAIL/AND | FAIL  | FAIL/BUT | WIN/BUT |  WIN  | WIN/AND |
| -------------- | :------: | :---: | :------: | :-----: | :---: | :-----: |
| STANDARD       |    1     | 2 3 4 |    5     |    6    | 7 8 9 |   10    |
| 3 HARDER       | 1 2 3 4  | 5 6 7 |    8     |    9    |  10   |         |
| DUNGEON        |    1     |  2 3  |    4     |    5    | 6 7 8 |  9 10   |
| EXPLORE/COMBAT |    1     |   2   |    3     |    4    | 5 6 7 | 8 9 10  |
>WIN: The activity occurs without difficulty, cost, or setback. 
>FAIL: For one reason or another, this action was beyond the scope of the character in the moment.
>Below WIN: Values below 'WIN' can be bought back through Exertion or Resource, or else becomes FAIL. The activity is within the character's scope, it just needs an extra push.
>WIN/AND: Otherwise called a Great Success, the character succeeds the task with flying colors, or something especially lucky happens. This may inspire the character, restoring a point of Exertion, provided none were spent in achieving this result, or replenish a missing point of Resources.
>FAIL/AND: Otherwise called a Great Failure or Catastrophic Failure, the character's efforts not only fail to produce beneficial results, but make the situation worse. This may forcibly expend a point of Resources or reduce an otherwise available point of energy to Exhausted, or lead the character to terribly incorrect beliefs.

Willingly spending a point of Resources allows the rolling of one additional d10, and adding +1 to the result of the final value produced.
Willingly spending a point of Exertion allows the rerolling of any one die, to use the new value. This marks the point as /. If the character uses a moment to rest, they roll a d10 for each / point. On a 4 or higher, the point is restored. On a 3 or lower, the point is marked X, as Exhausted, until the character can sleep.

### DUNGEON
#### 1.0) DUNGEON ENTRANCE
Arton may wish to check the surrounding area for any leads about what he can expect. Choose up to one Investigation. To Investigate more than once, spend a Resource or Exert.
##### >> 1.1 SEARCH FOR ANIMAL SIGN: IS THERE?
Roll 3d10 as an Explore roll, and choose whether to Exert Focus or not. Whether this structure was built by humans or not, in the centuries that followed, it could easily have been made home for some form of beast or another, which would leave signs such as tracks or droppings.
Exploration Resource use might be described here as a matter of physical exhaustion.
If Arton successfully prepared a Torch, it adds +1 to this Outcome.
###### >>> WIN 5-7
Arton is certain that no animals have decided to make this hole their burrow.
###### >>> WIN/AND 8+
Arton is certain no animals nest here, but it's not clear if there are darker reasons why.
###### >>> FAIL 2-3 (4, if unpaid)
Arton decides that if there is any sign of animals passing through here, he can't see it.
###### >>> FAIL/AND 1
Arton fails to identify any markings that may or may not belong to creatures, and decides employing an abundance of caution is for the best. Arton Exhausts one Poise.
#### >> 1.2 EXAMINE STRUCTURAL STABILITY: HOW STABLE?
Roll 3d10 as an Dungeoneering roll, and choose whether to Exert Focus or Endurance or not. Though built by humans, this structure has been in disrepair for centuries, and tree roots and other circumstances might have weakened the tunnel.
Spending Dungeoneering Resource might be described as using stone picks or brute force to tug at roots and stone.
###### >>> WIN 6-8
Though not an expert in such matters, Arton is fairly convinced that this tunnel is stable.
###### >>> WIN/AND 9+
Arton is well and truly confident that this tunnel has no danger of collapsing, as the tree roots have actually reinforced the walls. He recovers one Dungeoneering Resource.
###### >>> FAIL 2-4 (5, if unpaid)
Arton decides that he's not versed enough in this action to form an opinion about it.
###### >>> FAIL/AND 1
Arton is uncomfortable in his lack of knowledge, and feels that going into this tunnel might actually be a dangerous idea. He can summon the courage by Exhausting one Poise.
#### >> 1.3 WATCH FOR TRAPS AND DANGEROUS OBSTACLES: ARE THERE?
Roll 3d10 as a Dungoneering roll, and choose whether to Exert Focus or Endurance or not. Ruins of this sort are a haven for all manner of dangerous individuals. Bandits and brigands, cultists and dark wizards, and beastfolk who favor the wilderness over denser populations, may have set this tunnel up to collapse, rigged it with rusty blades or poisoned needles, triprope, or even just a bell to warn them of intruders. Any case is worthy of wariness.
Spending Dungeoneering Resource might be described as spending the energy to prod at holes and gaps, or special trap-disarming tools.
If Arton successfully prepared a Torch, it adds +1 to this Outcome.
###### >>> WIN 6-8
Though Arton discovers a closed and locked door in this tunnel, nothing about these circumstances suggest that anyone has been here to render the environment more dangerous than it already is.
###### >>> WIN/AND 9+
Arton is so convinced that no other intelligent being has been through this way in years, that his confidence is high the site is undiscovered entirely, and gains a +1 bonus on Physical Exertion rolls here.
###### >>> FAIL 2-4 (5, if unpaid)
If there are traps and the like here, Arton lacks the insight to discover it. Nevertheless, he presses on.
###### >>> FAIL/AND 1
Just because Arton can't see any traps, doesn't mean they aren't there, hidden by an exceptionally devious foe. Shaken by the fact he may be unwittingly going to his end, Arton must Exhaust one Poise to muster the courage to go on.
#### >> 1.4 PREPARE A TORCH
Light is a friend to those who find themselves in dark places. Roll 3d10 as an Exploration roll, and expend either one Exploration or Dungeoneering Resource to create a Torch, as Arton either has the materials or forages from some outside. Physical Exertion assists the Exploration cost, but not the Dungeoneering cost.
###### >>> WIN 5-7
Arton deftly produces the supplies for a torch, and lights it in good time. The torch grants a +1 bonus to all situations where Arton can see, and prevents the penalties from situations where he can't.
###### >>> WIN/AND 8+
Arton produces the materials for a torch, and on top of producing a light granting +1 bonus to all situations where Arton can see, and preventing the penalties from situations where he can't, the torch will not go out if dropped.
###### >>> FAIL 2-4
The flame is sputtery, or fails to light entirely. Arton can try again with another cost to Resources.
###### >>> FAIL/AND 1
The torch is sputtery, but Arton believes that maybe he can push through with it. He cannot spend another Resource to try again, but does not gain a +1 bonus to sight-based activities, and only halves the penalty from darkness. After each activity, Arton must roll a 10-sided die; on a 10, -1 for each activity after having lit the torch, the torch dies, leaving Arton in whatever darkness he finds himself in.

#### 2.0) DUNGEON ENTRANCE
Descending into the tunnel, water drips softly off the ceiling and onto moss-patched cobbled stone.
