A TENET is a general practice that a being follows. They can be described as habits, but ultimately, they're things the creature feel a sense of satisfaction from doing, a sense of vindication from doing it a specific way, or a sense of fulfillment from the knowledge it's been done. It can also be described as a feeling of purpose.

[[SPIRIT]]s tend to pursue action based on their tenets, but their tenets are usually more in line with their [[ESSENCE]], leading to strangely unusual or even alien tenets. A war god may have a tenet of achieving total victory, but a fire spirit's tenet could be anything from consumption, to growth in size and power, to the propagation of flame, or even "the transmutation of the world".
