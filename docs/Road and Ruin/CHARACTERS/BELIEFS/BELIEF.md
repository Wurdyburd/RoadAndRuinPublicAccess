A character's beliefs are a muddy collage of several different components:
- [[COMPULSION]]S: Beliefs that cause you to proactively behave a certain way.
- [[INTERPRETATION]]S: Beliefs that involve perception of a thing in a certain way. This can lead to Compulsions.
- [[TRADITION]]S: Things you build into everyday life, that bring you peace of mind, and stability. These can also lead to Compulsions, and are often based on Interpretations.

These often manifest in larger belief structures, held by communities:
- [[LAW]]: Rules, actions that you must not take, on pain of consequence.
- [[TENET]]: Habits, activities that enable a sense of satisfaction or vindication.

Performing in a way that not only doesn't align with your character's beliefs, but actively runs counterintuitive to them, can lead to [[HOLLOWING]], as you spend [[SPIRIT POINTS]] to force behavior upon yourself.


> 1. > Ex. A paladin sees someone getting mugged in the street, and has the Compulsion to [Help the Defenseless], jumping in to protect the innocent; after all, outnumbering someone who is clearly defeated can't be true justice. However, on investigation, they find the person getting attacked is actually a thief, well known to prowl the area, stealing food out of windows and coin out of pocket. The Paladin has Interpreted that [Stealing is Wrong], even to survive; it is morally incomprehensible, and they agree that the person should be punished for this crime that they've committed. Part of this comes from the Paladin's homeland, where they work hard to ensure food and shelter for refugees and the needy. Soup kitchens make sure people are fed, and blankets and a place to stay are the responsibility of all. This Tradition states that no one should ever have to stoop to thievery in the first place, and so while any act of thievery is Bad, the circumstances surrounding the thief mean the town is to blame as well, so the Paladin will have a word with the city council about their failings.


Loosely, if a player performs an action that contradicts their character's design, you can either roll a Poise Saving Throw to see if you can convince them to act out of character, or simply force them to spend a Spirit Point. In the case of supernatural enforcement, your god may elect to tax you even further, or strip you of any blessings that you received from them, until you can perform enough tasks in their name to prove penance.
