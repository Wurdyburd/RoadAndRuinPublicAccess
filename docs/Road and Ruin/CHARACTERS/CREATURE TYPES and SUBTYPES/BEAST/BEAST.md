[[BEAST]]s are of middling to low intelligence. While they may recognize and learn patterns, or be trained to follow spoken commands, they don't necessarily understand speech, and while they may band into packs, herds, or flocks, any complex social framework that emerges tends to lack individuality. Many of their actions are taken purely out of survival and self-preservation necessity, including attacking or killing other creatures. These may be of the [[ANIMAL]] or [[MONSTER]] variety.
