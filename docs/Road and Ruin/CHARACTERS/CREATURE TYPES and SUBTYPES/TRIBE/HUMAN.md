By far the most common and numerous of the tribes, it is never surprising to explore and find humans have already been there. Though not strictly a powerful species, humanity’s word carries heavy weight in many regions, as their aptitude for just about anything and raw determination have seen them create some of the more impressive structures and advancements of the modern era.

Humans can come to be quite varied, visually, as humans from one region may differ significantly from other humans even right next door, geographically. However, despite visual discrepancies, all humans are essentially equally as capable as any other.
Supporting a wide spectrum of belief systems, philosophies, practices, and technologies, their differences are as much a strength as it is a weakness.
- Humans typically reach full maturity in their early 20s and, barring misfortune, can live to see 100 years, though few manage half that in the World of Ruin.
- They generally manifest tones of earthy shades with shoulder-length hair
- Height may range from 1.5-1.8m(5-6ft, Size 3), though there are some outliers.

Though self-described individually as lovers of peace and quiet, it’s no secret that humans, as a race, are among the most heavily militant, constructing towering fortifications, while training enormous armies, arming them with deadly weaponry, and spreading them to every corner of the vast wilderness. Humans are also perhaps one of the more suspecting races, in practise bordering on paranoia and xenophobia; given the choice, a human will almost always choose another human, however untrustworthy, over aid or partnership with a member of another race. Though, that doesn’t mean that humanity puts stock in brotherhood either: humans seem to end up warring amongst each other just as much as with other races, if not more so, over anything from border disputes and land, to raw materials and food, or the right to rule, and even things deemed absurd to some other races, such as familial honor, religion, and love.
