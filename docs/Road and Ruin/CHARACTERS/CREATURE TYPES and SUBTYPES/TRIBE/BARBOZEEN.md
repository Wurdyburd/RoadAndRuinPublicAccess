Barbozeen are one of several monstrous tribes, due to their extreme genetic diversity. They host a palette of muddy hues, ranging from murky browns to vibrant greens and yellows, with skin more similar to the smooth scale of a snake than porous skin, and hair ranging from tawny browns to russet reds often short and clumped. Similarities tend to stop at this already-varied description, as each clan of barbozeen boast an incredibly diverse range of sizes, weights, and shapes, not to speak of culture.

- Barbozeen often reach maturity in their mid-20s, but some tribes experience a second, or even multiple, additional stages of growth some decades later, into their elderly 80s-90s.
- Their height tends on the taller side of human, at 6-8ft (2-2.4m, Size 4), though fly to the size of towering halfgiants and sink to the lows of the size of human children, at their most extreme.
- They often sport a muzzle of some variety, with somewhat larger canine teeth than many other races, sometimes verging on tusks. These can often be regrown if damaged, and some clans wear them as trophies or decoration in jewellery or clothing, and may be carved or dyed.
- Barbozeen can sometimes have boney protrusions and dense knobs in their skin, and have small or large horns, though not ever to the extent of antlers.
- Some barbozeen possess tails, which can be thick and lizardlike and short or long, or thin and tufted on the end, though these are much more extreme mutations.
- Overall, their traits can include IMPISH, LARGE, CANID, UNGULATE, REPTILIAN, MAMMALIAN, URSINE, CARNIVOROUS, OMNIVOROUS, and/or HUMANOID.

Barbozeen are social enough as a tribe to group together into clans for family structure, and small bands of 4-6 while travelling together. Solitary 'zeen can sometimes be seen employed as warriors, bodyguards, or builders, though it is rare that they fail to bond with at least one other.

Common clan observances include a more 'barbaric' lifestyle, as some who live in cities might say, constructing buildings and clothes roughly and for utility purposes, but also a distinct sense of honor and trust, and respect of heritage and ancestry.
One unusual similarity between the clans is a culture of maskmaking, though each clan and individual tends to have their own unique spin on things. Some will wear them on the face, or around the head as a helmet, while others pad a shoulder, or a chestplate, or even carry it as a shield. The themes appear defensive and protective, much like a guardian spirit.
Typically a coming-of-age ritual, a mask is carved of wood or bone, or even stone, and hold in great reverence, treating it partially as its own entity, partially an extension of the wearer and maker.
These masks are only replaced when necessary, and even the taking of a new name will often only alter the existing mask. They are buried with their owner upon death, or as much of the mask retrieved as possible.
