TRIBES are beings of high intelligence, who often band together and live in communities, observe specific rites and traditions, and develop a culture. They have the capacity for speech, craftsmanship, and trade, they develop a morality, and desire a sense of purpose, beyond just simple survival. These three facets combine to form a society, which are defined by [[LAW]] and [[TENET]].

Tribes may fracture or diverge as the distance between members grows, either over physical distances, from being too large to easily travel or with an obstacle in the way that prevents such, or due to disagreements which cause members of a community to become isolated from each other. Given enough time, this can lead to variations between descendants over many generations, as their genes no longer intermingle, and changes to cultural foundations until they no longer resemble each other or their ancestors. This gives rise to a [[RACE]], where [[BELIEF]]s, practices, or isolated mutation affects genetic heritage to such a degree that it affects descendants of the Tribe. Note, however, that creatures can still be adopted into other cultures, and while they may lack genetic markers, they can still fully be a member of their adopted race.
