The Gobbh are much smaller than a typical [[BARBOZEEN]], and their diminutive, impish appearance gave rise to the "gobling" or "goblin" moniker by non-barbozeen, and use speed, stealth, or skills to get ahead and avoid or get out of danger.

Physical traits associated with the Gobbh:
- Short, approximately Size 2, or 1-1.5m (2.5-4ft), or the size and weight of a human child. Thinner arms and legs end in larger hands and feet and head, including large pointed bat ears.
- Can be extremely quick and precise, but also very intelligent and sociable. They will often use these traits to avoid direct confrontation, where they may be overpowered or threatened, and their comparably small size can work against them.
- Hair of varying length on the back of the head, of darker browns to blue-oily blacks.
- Smaller muzzle, with sharper teeth, and either large or small eyes, which can be effective at seeing in the dark. This can give them an impish, or even lizardlike appearance.
- Much stronger skin color, of greens, browns, yellows, reds, or blues, that wrinkles and sags with age.
- They may have a short, triangular, reptilian tail stub, a longer reptilian tail, or a thin tail with a tuft on the end.

Cultural traits shared by the Gobbh clan:
- Hair can be varied, but is common to tie back or cut if the length poses a risk.
- Resources are distributed according to need, and large village structures, where parental responsibilities aren't strictly defined, mean that independent ownership is a foreign concept. As such, the Gobbh are not inherently covetous, providing resources and assistance when possible, but from the outside, can appear as criminals and thieves.
- Village structures are often underground or in caves, where there is a significantly reduced risk of discovery and attack or invasion. A village may move locations as it's population grows or shrinks, or may split if the population grows too high. In such a case, village relocation is done quietly and discreetly, often to the extent that other nearby towns and cities are surprised by the discovery of Gobbh who have been nearby for months or even years, but the two halves of a split will often both relocate at the same time, parting as friend and family.
- All Gobbh who deal with the outside world tend to develop at least one technique for risk avoidance or threat escape. This may be through speed, running into small cover or striking first, crafting devices that repel or defuse, casting spells from a safe distance, or having a network of allies and failsafes that intervene on their behalf. This makes them both incredibly desirable as specialists in many fields, while also earning ire and distrust, for being "selfish", or "cowardly".
EQUIPMENT
- Gobbh uphold the barbozeen tradition of masking by crafting one themselves. It is considered a respectable pastime to refine the mask, and replacing the mask with a new, better-crafted one isn't unheard of. Many Gobbh don't actually wear their mask, instead housing it in their den with any of their other belongings, which, like other belongings, is considered freely accessible to all. Personalization or representation by the mask is made that much more powerful by having it available to the world, though it's not clear why anyone would need it. This puts them at odds with other barbozeen clans, who covet their masks dearly, and the offer to trade or let them borrow a mask would baffle and infuriate other clans.
- Tools and weapons, designed to go around obstacles, or through with as much speed, precision, and preparedness as possible, such as daggers, spyglasses, lockpicks, or tinkerers' tools.
- Light or no armor, since the added bulk would only reduce the Gobbh's evasion, speed, or stealth.
PROFICIENCY - Pick 4 per class selection
- SIMPLE WEAPONS, that are either small enough to be used quickly, like daggers, or have the LONG trait, such as spears, to strike before being struck.
- AMMUNITION WEAPONS, such as bows, or slings.
- SHIELDS, of any size, to either deflect incoming hits with skill, or cover the entire body.
- CRAFTS and MANIPULATION, to build custom equipment to size spec, and build their way out of problems.
- ENTRAPMENT and STRATEGY, both to evade capture, as well as to undermine other larger and more dangerous creatures, and those who present a social obstacle.
- HARVEST and HERBALISM, for MEDICINE, and poisons, and for a self-sufficient food source.
- RESEARCH, RITUAL, SPIRITUALISM, and other magics. Gobbh enjoy the notion of producing effects independent of their otherwise small or weak stature.
- ATHLETICS and STEALTH. Gobbh are able to run, jump, climb, and hide, if direct combat is avoided.
- BINDING, HUSBANDRY, and RIDE: Gobbh may opt to tame creatures to perform their labor and fighting for them, and even ride creatures like wolves or large spiders.
- DECEPTION, EMPATHY, MEDIATION, and PERSUASION are all tools a Gobbh may employ to be a savvy negotiator, brokering deals and deflecting threats.
BELIEFS
- COMPULSIONS: Extreme fight-flight-or-night response, to attack, run, retreat, or withdraw from attention exposed to sudden events, such as loud noise or shocking revelations, in order to process and approach the event from the ideal angle.
- INTERPRETATIONS: Resources should be used for those who require them at the given moment. Confrontation can solve conflicts, and is sometimes the only or best way to do so, but preparation, patience, and evasion are also great tools to use, especially in combinations.
- TRADITIONS: Gobbh will leave the nest in rotations, to seek and retrieve resources, to scout and explore, and to do combat and defend, when necessary. Each Gobbh is responsible for crafting a mask for themselves, out of any material and in any style they choose, and what the mask means is personal, including whether it's actually personal or not.
- LAW: Those who do not take responsibility when it is their turn and are able, are merely a guest, to be respected and entertained, but eventually expelled, all without the trust and the family of kin.
- TENET: Provide to those who are in need of what you are not yourself using. Pursue your own personal strength, and celebrate the strengths and triumphs of those who's strength you benefit from, as well as those who you grant your strengths to.
