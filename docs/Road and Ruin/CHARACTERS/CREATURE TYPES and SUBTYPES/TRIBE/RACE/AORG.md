Aorg barbozeen, commonly called 'orks' by human cultures, are a proud and confident race, and not many would dare dispute their prowess, on account of their remarkable durability, and excellence in martial combat.

Physical traits associated with Aorg:
- Standing at an imposing height of 2-2.4m (6-8ft, Size 4), and weighing as much as a small horse, their intimidating figure either belies an otherwise hospitable and good-natured personality, or fully delivers on the threatening silhouette.
- Long, mane-like hair on the back of the head, of red and muddy browns, and the occasional stray blond, black, or white hair.
- Thick arms and legs, with squarish fingers and toes.
- Large teeth, especially the lower canines, which protrude upwards out of the bottom lip like tusks.
- Squarish muzzle, with a smaller nose.
- Smallish eyes for the frame of the head, but possessing a sort of intensity.
- Darker, yellower green scaleskin, that wrinkles and folds with high age.

Cultural traits shared by those within the Aorg clan:
- Hair is worn long and clumped, chopped roughly into shape, or tied back using cord or braids.
- Teeth or bone, which may be carved or dyed, sewn into clothing and dangling from cords.
- Families live in a village constructed of tents with bent supports, stretching lengths of cloth or hide between them, decorated with dangling feather and bone chimes, and patterned with paints and simple dyes. These tents are suitable for a variety of temperatures and weather, while also being lightweight and simple enough to quickly dismantle, transport, and erect in a new location, should circumstances demand it.
- Aorg that travel alone are often suspicious and aggressive toward others. Otherwise, Aorg can be found in small bounds of 4-6 for most activities.
EQUIPMENT
- Aorg who perform the mask ritual carry their mask with them, choosing to either wear it as a helmet, or forming it into large protective armor, such as a shoulderpad, chestplate, or medium or large shield.
- Simple weapons, and throwing javelins, with the HEAVY trait. Aorg prefer weighted weapons that benefit their strength, which will often have components made of dense wood, thick iron orbs and disks, large bones, or even chunks of stone, which may be chipped or carved to a brutal edge.
- Layered armor, made of multiple components and materials, scavenged from the fallen or bought or traded for cheap. It does the job, but it's often not pretty, or present a unified fighting force.
PROFICIENCY - pick 4 per class selection
- SIMPLE WEAPONS, such as axes or maces. Swords are possible, but less common, and daggers may be carried, but rarely trained with for fighting. Often makes use of the HEAVY trait.
- THROWN WEAPONS, such as javelins, for hunting.
- CRAFTS, in order to easily improvise whatever may be needed, out of whatever's at hand.
- HERBALISM, HARVEST, and SURVIVAL, to forage food and medicine from nature, and be prepared for wild animals and changes in terrain.
- RITUAL, and SPIRITUALISM, if leading the rites for crafting masks and revering the ancestors.
- ATHLETICS and HAULING to carry your life on your back, a travelling nomad.
- INTIMIDATION and PRESENCE. Those who lead the Aorg often do so through force, be it with violence, or will. Those who are difficult to defeat or discouraging to challenge, will lead the tribe in conquest, or protect them from threats in time of peace.
BELIEFS
- COMPULSIONS: To act and speak without thinking, especially when roused to anger, pride, or love.
- INTERPRETATIONS: Strength is required to both produce change and resist change. Those who are strong hold respect, responsibility, and the future of those who are not. Those who came before will look after those who came after, in their own way, for true strength is eternal.
- TRADITIONS: Having proved yourself using your power to dominate a powerful foe or protect your kin, qualifies you for the mask-donning ceremony. The mask represents your ancestors, and donning the mask both has you join them as a guardian, and borrows their power to help protect the living. Strength must be proven to lead, and the defeat of the current leader and all competing allies required before you have the right to wield that power against your foes.
- LAW: The destruction of a mask is punishable by banishment, or death. Combat is to remain honorable, and without trickery or deception. When the clan is threatened, all rise to defend the other.
- TENET: Help and defend those who have not yet had the opportunity to grow and defend another. Pursue personal strength, both physical and strength of character, to become an ancestor your descendants will be proud of, and so that you may watch over them. Be of open mind, and curious.
