The Ha-Aorg, or "half-ork", have a root origin shared with the Aorg clan, though the significant differences in their appearance lead some scholars to believe that there was a schism in the community that lead similarly-minded barbozeen to leave, forming their own clan.

Physical traits associated with the Ha-Aorg:
- While still tall, Ha-Aorg average about 1.5-2m (Size 3), and tend to weigh quite heavily for their otherwise humanoid frame.
- They are quicker than their Aorg cousins, both in physical speed and in temperament, faster to anger, to calm, and to humor.
- Long, mane-like hair on the back of the head, of red and muddy browns, with occasional streaks of blond, black, or white hair.
- Much more varied in build, the strong possess thick and heavy limbs and bodies, but there are also those who favor speed and precision, or intellect and wisdom, or social wellbeing.
- A more powerful, defined jaw may or may not have larger teeth or any tusks at all.
- A squarish face can have a more pronounced muzzle than what reads as human, more like a large cat, wolf, or bison.
- Dark eyes are often sunk below a heavier brow.
- Darker, yellower green scaleskin, that wrinkles and sags with high age.


Cultural traits shared by those of the Ha-Aorg clan:
- Hair is worn long and clumped, chopped roughly into shape, or tied  back using cord or braids.
- Teeth or bone, which may be carved or dyed, sewn into clothing and dangling from cords.
- Families live in a village constructed of tents with bent supports, stretching lengths of cloth or hide between them, decorated with dangling feather and bone chimes, and patterned with paints and simple dyes. These tents are suitable for a variety of temperatures and weather, while also being lightweight and simple enough to quickly dismantle, transport, and erect in a new location, should circumstances demand it.
- Aorg that travel alone are often suspicious and aggressive toward others. Otherwise, Aorg can be found in small bounds of 4-6 for most activities.
EQUIPMENT
- Aorg who perform the mask ritual carry their mask with them, choosing to either wear it as a helmet, or forming it into large protective armor, such as a shoulderpad, chestplate, or medium or large shield.
- Simple weapons, and throwing javelins, with the HEAVY trait. Ha-Aorg prefer weighted weapons that benefit their strength, which will often have components made of dense wood, thick iron orbs and disks, large bones, or even chunks of stone, which may be chipped or carved to a brutal edge. Some favor swords, spears, or daggers. Ha-Aorg have also been known to use bows.
- Layered armor, made of multiple components and materials, scavenged from the fallen or bought or traded for cheap. It does the job, but it's often not pretty, or present a unified fighting force.

- ATHLETICS and HAULING to carry your life on your back, a travelling nomad.
- INTIMIDATION and PRESENCE. Many disputes among the Ha-Aorg are resolved, begrudgingly, with barking words or a blow to the head. Even non-combative Ha-Aorg can come to project a truly threatening aura, warding off conflicts and keeping the dispossessed in line.
BELIEFS
- COMPULSIONS: To act and speak without thinking, especially when roused to anger, pride, love, or humor.
- INTERPRETATIONS: Strength produces results, both in strength of body, and strength of will, of mind, and of character. Those who are not strong cannot be expected to produce results, and those who rely on or manipulate the strength of others are abhorrent.
- TRADITIONS: With the coming of age, you are bestowed a mask, marking you both a member of the clan, and responsible for its wellbeing and success. Your mask is your reputation, and should be visible and seen during success and performing your duties.
- LAW: Those who work to undermine the success of the collective must be punished or destroyed. Those who would harm children, as the inheritors of your labors, and who will carry your successes into the future, are to be dealt with quickly, and severely.
- TENET: Pursue the spoils of your hard work. Eat, drink, and laugh, play and dance, tell stories, and revel in the warmth of family and friends. Be the best that you can be, and help lift others to be the same.
