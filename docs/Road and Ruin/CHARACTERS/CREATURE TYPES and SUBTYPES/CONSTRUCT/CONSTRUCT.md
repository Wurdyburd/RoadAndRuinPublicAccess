Constructs typically have a power source that propels their actions, either electrical or arcane in origin. Any moving parts tend to be a point of vulnerability, but while damage to a limb, jammed piston, or frozen cog may prevent actions that rely on those parts, it doesn't necessarily inflict trauma on the construct itself.

Constructs use any autonomy they have to fulfill instructions laid out by an outside entity, in the form of [[LAW]] and [[TENET]]; either their creator, or edited by someone else, even if that was to lay the foundation for the construct to make decisions for itself.

Constructs lack any kind of spiritual or mental energy, and are purely physical creatures, aside from their power source.
