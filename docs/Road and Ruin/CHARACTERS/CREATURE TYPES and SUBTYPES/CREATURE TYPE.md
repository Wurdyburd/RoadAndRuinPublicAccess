#### CREATURE TYPES and SUBTYPES
'Creature' broadly refers to any being that has any kind of autonomy, and the ability to assign itself tasks to perform.

- [[TRIBE]]s are higher intellect species who form communities, observe rites and traditions, and develop culture. They speak [[LANGUAGE]], build and trade, and develop a morality defined by [[LAW]] and [[TENET]]. Enough separation can lead to development of a [[RACE]], with a genetic heritage and different cultural practices.
- [[BEAST]]s are of middling to low intelligence, and though they may form communities and recognize patterns, they don't necessarily understand speech, and often act purely out of instinct. They may be defined as an [[ANIMAL]], or a [[MONSTER]].
- [[SPIRIT]]s are often intangible, metaphysical entities, a concept made manifest, and so may be quite alien. [[ELEMENTAL]]s, [[FAE]], [[YOKAI]], [[GHOST]]s, [[TOTEM]]s, [[DEMON]]s, and even [[GOD]]s are defined by their [[ESSENCE]] and [[ASPECT]], symbolized by [[ICON]]s, and may follow [[LAW]]s and [[TENET]]s.
- [[CONSTRUCT]]s are defined purely by their [[LAW]] and [[TENET]], which is generally assigned to them by another, often their creator. They lack spiritual or mental energy, as purely physical creatures, aside from a power source.



#### RACE
A RACE is a divergence of beliefs, practices, or mutations that affect a genetic heritage to such a degree that it affects descendants of a Tribe.
