A RACE is a divergence of beliefs, practices, or mutations that affect a genetic heritage to such a degree that it affects descendants of a [[TRIBE]].

Tribes may fracture or diverge as the distance between members grows, either over physical distances, from being too large to easily travel or with an obstacle in the way that prevents such, or due to disagreements which cause members of a community to become isolated from each other. Given enough time, this can lead to variations between descendants over many generations, as their genes no longer intermingle, and changes to cultural foundations until they no longer resemble each other or their ancestors.

Note, however, that creatures can still be adopted into other cultures, and while they may lack genetic markers, they can still fully be a member of their adopted race.

#### EXAMPLES OF TRIBES

| NAME           | PARENT        | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                               |
| -------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[AORG]]       | [[BARBOZEEN]] | Tall, strong, and prone to resolving complications with violence or strength. The strong lead, but that doesn't always make them tyrants. |
| [[HA-AORG]]    | [[BARBOZEEN]] |                                                                                                                                           |
| [[GOBBH]]        | [[BARBOZEEN]] | Short, impish, and often of animated personality. Often look to use their small size to their benefit.                                    |
|                | [[HUMAN]]     |                                                                                                                                           |

| [[HIGH CLASS]] | [[PALE ELF]]  | Separated by wealth and politics, High Class Pale Elves see themselves as inherently superior to most.                                    |
| [[LOW CLASS]]  | [[PALE ELF]]  |                                                                                                                                           |
