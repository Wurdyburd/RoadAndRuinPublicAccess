If a given activity requires knowledge or expertise that is the result of repeated trail and error, or based on information that can't possibly be guessed at without prior knowledge, that activity is described as a discipline.

Disciplines require [[SPECIALIZATION]] in the chosen task or particular sphere of information, or else the threshold of Fail-And and Failure increases by 5 points each.
