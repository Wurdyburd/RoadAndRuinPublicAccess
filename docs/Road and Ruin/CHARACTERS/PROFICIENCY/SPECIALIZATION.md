Some characters gain features that grant you a degree of expertise that simultaneously goes beyond the realm of a simple proficiency combination, in a topic that's too narrow or niche to be broadly applicable.
Having a [[SPECIALIZATION]] in a specific approach to a specific activity, defined as a combination of two of Who, What, When, Where, Why, or How, grants a bonus to skill checks:
- ADDUP: Adds another die to the pool, put down as a guaranteed 10.
- OUTCOME: Grants +5 bonus, in the same way as Monstrous does. This lets a more mortal specialist compete with monsters, but monstrous specialists, like gods, be truly powerful.

Example specializations:
- INTERROGATION: Getting information, by Threatening/harming
- PICKPOCKETING: Taking belongings, Without getting noticed
- RESCUE CARRY: Carrying another person, Who's too injured to move
- ORGAN TRANSPLANT: Organ removal, Organ reinstallment
- EXORCISM: Recognizing demons, Expelling demons
- TRAPBUSTING: Anticipating traps, Disarming traps

When an action requires specialization, in that it cannot be achieved simply without proven training or foreknowledge, that action is called a [[DISCIPLINE]].
In such an event, the threshold of Fail-And and Failure increases by 5 points each.
