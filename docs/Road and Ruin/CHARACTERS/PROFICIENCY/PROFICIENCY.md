Proficiencies describe a practice or an innate knack for certain kinds of activity.

Each proficiency can grant between 0 and 5 points of benefit, and up to two relevant proficiencies can be applied to a situational dice roll at a time.

_____________________
Some characters gain features that grant you a degree of expertise that simultaneously goes beyond the realm of a simple proficiency combination, in a topic that's too narrow or niche to be broadly applicable.
Having a [[SPECIALIZATION]] in a specific approach to a specific activity, defined as a combination of two of Who, What, When, Where, Why, or How, grants a bonus to skill checks:
- ADDUP: Adds another die to the pool, put down as a guaranteed 10.
- OUTCOME: Grants +5 bonus, in the same way as Monstrous does. This lets a more mortal specialist compete with monsters, but monstrous specialists, like gods, be truly powerful.

Proficiencies that cannot be effectively guessed at, require information not part of the local lexicon, or have significant or severe consequences for failure, are marked as requiring [[DISCIPLINE]].

While proficiencies are largely grouped as Physical, Mental, or Social, wherever awareness, intuition, community, building, or knowledge come into play, these proficiencies represent experience enough to apply.
