A mental proficiency. Mastery of communication and information retention techniques, whether written, spoken, or encoded.

When operating outside of your primary language or alphabet system, but not a cipher based on your language, specialization is required to correctly communicate what you want to, the way you want to, as a [[DISCIPLINE]].

Can be used as a spellcasting [[METHOD]], and in [[RITUAL]]s, with enough training or discipline.
