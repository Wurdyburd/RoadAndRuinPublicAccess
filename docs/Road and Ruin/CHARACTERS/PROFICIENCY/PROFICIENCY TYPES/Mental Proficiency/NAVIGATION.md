A mental proficiency. The ability to sense direction, re-trace footsteps, understand the relationship of two locations in distance, obstacles separating them, and time to travel between them, including locations you've never been to.

Can be used to navigate natural formations and structures, and re-trace paths in mazes, but not intuit the correct path through a maze. Also used in the use of maps and their creation in map-making.
