### THE THRILL OF THE HUNT

The hunt is as old as stories themselves. Armed with tooth and claw, net and spear, baying hounds and thundering mounts, natural blinds and cover of night, the hunter and the hunted are not always who they initially believe themselves to be. But in all cases, a heady chase gives way to victory: either the pursuer, secure in food or boastful glory, or the prey, who escapes long enough to see another sunrise.

#### WHO USES THIS SKILL?

Huntmasters are as old as time itself, from the moment one creature deigned to feast upon another. Today, hunting serves several purposes, including sustenance, glory, retrieval, or protection, destroying that which can and has destroyed you. Rangers, bounty hunters, dragonslayers, all perfect their techniques to detect, pursue, and restrain, then deliver, slay, and harvest anything and anyone that needs serve.

A hunter should consider both their method of hunting, as well as their typical prey, and for what reason they might do this activity.

With Themes of Combat, Monsters, Pursuit, Trapping, Binding, and Teamwork, Classes who pursue and take down difficult to find or difficult to slay targets will find effective tools in this Skill Tag.
