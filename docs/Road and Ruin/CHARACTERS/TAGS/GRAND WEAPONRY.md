#### WHO USES THIS SKILL?

Whether carried by the monstrous or the absurd, grandweapon masters are nothing short of intimidating, and almost always use their techniques in the utter demolition of targets too tough for anything less to handle. Dragonslayers, miners and loggers, and the truly destructive of coastal raiders crash, smash, and bash their way through anything foolish enough to remain standing before them, shattering rock and wood and bone alike.

When creating a grandweapon user, beyond thoughts about how impressive they are, question what causes they pledge their tool to. While many are in it for personal gain in some fashion or another, others swing the felhammer and cleaver to defeat monstrous creatures who threaten towns and villages, and still others take up the broadback shield as a matter of defense, standing between those they would protect and that which would destroy them.

With Themes of Combat, Monsters, etc etc, Classes who walk the destructive path of giants are among those who would use the abilities in this Skill Tag.
