| *The tool of the invader, the aggressor, and the subjugator. Lacking elegance, and excelling in raw force, the will to destroy is a powerful weapon in its own right, made more so by versatility on the battlefield, and guarantee of a quick kill.*<br><br>~Seltor’s Array of Armaments: Vol.I |

### WEAPONS OF VIOLENCE

Martial Weaponry skills are commonly employed by those who who use violence as their means to an end. Mercenaries, soldiers, bandits, marauders and raiders all use the weapons most likely to get the job done quick, and move on to the next one. Tactics and mercy are usually furthest from their mind, which is usually fixated on bloodlust, glory, or just sheer efficiency.

#### WHO USES THIS SKILL?

The characters most likely to use Martial Weaponry are those who enter combat as a first resort, or who understand that it may be their last. Words of reason bear little impact on unthinking hordes of undead, or beasts who don't understand the common tongue, and sometimes, the only thing that will stop someone who wants you dead is a sharp blade.

Consider if your character uses their weapon of choice for violence's sake, or to protect others. Their particular fighting style may be bred from necessity, from the culture of their homeland, or mandated by military cohesion.

With **Themes** of Combat, Conquering, Violence, Death, Blood, and Glory, Classes who can survive in a fight or who stand to gain from being in one will benefit from this Skill Tag.

### OVERVIEW

Martial Weaponry is defined by three things:
- Increased damage to enemies. The battle-hardened and combat trained can effectively eliminate threats, and clear multitudes before being overwhelmed.
- Increased mobility and positioning capability. Melee is limited by range, and require extra stamina to close gaps.
- Domino combat. The longer you fight, the more combat snowballs to a victorious conclusion.

Features:
- Manipulation of the Distracted status, by ignoring it's effects, and staggering enemies you can reach.
- Weaponry enhancement. Striking things different ways, additional times, faster, harder.
- Obstacle destruction in the pursuit of conquest. If a wall pops up, it gets torn down. If a door is locked, it gets knocked in. If an enemy is heavily armored, it's only a matter of time before that armor is reduced to scraps.

Some synergies:
- Champions. Hero, villain, strongman, or tank, fighters like to take the spotlight and hold it, as victor.
- Overkill. For when features trigger results for excess, big numbers reap big rewards.
- War Mythos. Incredible violence draws the eyes of violent gods, who harness Rage and whose shamans use spirit energy.

As dip, Martial Weaponry provides anyone interested in defending themselves the clarity to prefer a weapon, and reward aggressive behaviour.

The **Talent** allows you Insight on the battlefield, and rewards you for multiple consecutive turns in combat as a domino effect, especially for moving from one opponent to another.
Martial Weaponry defines skills used for melee warfare, using highly aggressive but simple techniques with basic weapons.
