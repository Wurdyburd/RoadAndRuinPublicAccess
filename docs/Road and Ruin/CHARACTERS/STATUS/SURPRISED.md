Surprised is a state a creature assumes when they're exposed to new information at such speed and significance, that they must either react quickly, and often poorly, or be struck still until they have had the opportunity to process the information and assess the correct response.

Creatures who fail a Reaction saving throw gain stacks of [[DISTRACTED]] relative to how disrupting the new information was.

| OUTCOME     | DISTRACTION STACKS                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| FAIL AND    | The creature suffers 3 stacks, and when removing a stack, roll Reaction again. In the event of any failure, the duration is instead renewed.                       |
| FAILURE     | 2 stacks.                                                                                                                                                          |
| FAIL BUT    | 1 stack.                                                                                                                                                           |
| SUCCESS BUT | The creature fails to conceal their surprise, but responds well.                                                                                                   |
| SUCCESS     | The creature is has accounted for this possibility to the point they are not surprised.                                                                            |
| SUCCESS AND | The creature is not surprised, but recognizes that they should be. Gain a +1 in similar surprise attempt saving throws, or attempts to act convincingly surprised. |
