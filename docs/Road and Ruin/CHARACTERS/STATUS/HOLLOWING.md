Hollowing occurs when a creature has become emotionally, spiritually exhausted, as a result of having spent their reserve of [[SPIRIT POINTS]] into depletion, or lower.

Each stage of Hollowing inflicts 2 Bad [[LUCK]] to Social skill checks per stage. Spending 1SP extra negates a stage of Hollowing.


| STAGE    | EXAMPLE (ASSUMING 3SP)                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Healthy  | 3                                     |
| Empty    | 0                                     |
| x1       | -3                                    |
| x2       | -6                                    |
| x3       | -9                                    |
| x4       | -12                                   |
| Soulless | Only possible via supernatural means. |

Deals with devils and the like may also take SP, often in amounts far in excess of what it would take to become Soulless. It is up to the savvy warlock to try to negotiate a better deal, or substitute this cost somehow.
