In each attribute type, there is a PRECISION attribute, which affects accuracy of effect, especially over range and scope.

- [[DEXTERITY]]: (DEX) Physical Precision used to aim, dodge, balance, and respond to events with any degree of speed and precision. Is used by accuracy-based weapons, like projectiles and spears.
- [[WITS]]: (WIT) Mental Precision used for spatial awareness, keeping track of multiple things in space and time, and noticing changes in the environment. Pairs with Dexterity for reacting to events as they're happening.
- [[CONNECTION]]: (CON) Spiritual Precision, used to both disguise and discern intent, as well as to emotionally project and cause the desired change in the feelings of others.
