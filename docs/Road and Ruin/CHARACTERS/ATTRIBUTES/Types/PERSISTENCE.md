In each attribute type, , there is a PERSISTENCE attribute, which affects duration of effects, and resistance to outside effects.

- [[ENDURANCE]]: (END) Physical Persistence used to resist disease, and exert yourself for long periods of time. Defines the extent of armor you can wear.
- [[FOCUS]]: (FOC) Mental Persistence, for dedication to an activity. Retaining awareness and being able to concentrate on maintaining a spell's complexity over periods of time.
- [[POISE]]: (POI) Spiritual Persistence, used to resist fear, exhaustion, and the manipulations of others, and to continue to appear cool under pressure.

These three stats combine to determine a character's [[STEADFAST]] maximum.
