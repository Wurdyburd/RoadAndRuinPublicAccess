Creatures in Road and Ruin are defined primarily by nine attributes. These are split into three types:
- [[PHYSICAL]], Martial, Body.
- [[MENTAL]], Magical, Mind.
- [[SOCIAL]], Spiritual, Soul.

In each, there is a
- [[POWER]] attribute. Affects outward force, and magnitude of effect.
- [[PRECISION]] attribute. Affects accuracy of effect, especially over range and scope.
- [[PERSISTENCE]] attribute. Affects duration of effects, and resistance to outside effects.

If an action could realistically be performed with a different attribute than normally expected, such as breaking a lock with Strength rather than picking it with Dexterity, the other attribute may be used, within reason: A lock cannot be expected to be opened with Poise or Focus, for example.



- ADDUP: Roll an attribute as a number of d10 rolled whenever making an ability check. The value of all d10s are added together, with every set of 10 points resulting in one additional Skill Success.
- OUTCOME: Based on a human average of 3 in each field, if an activity requires capabilities in excess of what you possess, it incurs an equal penalty to the Outcome die. Activities requiring capabilities beneath you grants an equal bonus.

| ---------------- | ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **[[PHYSICAL]]** | [[STRENGTH]]     | [[DEXTERITY]]  | [[ENDURANCE]]   | [[EXERTION]] (STA)     |
| **[[MENTAL]]**   | [[INTELLIGENCE]] | [[WITS]]       | [[FOCUS]]       | [[MANA]] (MP)          |

- [[STRENGTH]]: (STR) Physical Power attribute, used to lift, throw, push, and pull. This defines the weight of weapon you can heft and effectively swing, but also your ability to lift yourself and climb up surfaces.
- [[DEXTERITY]]: (DEX) Physical Precision used to aim, dodge, balance, and respond to events with any degree of speed and precision. Is used by accuracy-based weapons, like projectiles and spears.
- [[ENDURANCE]]: (END) Physical Persistence used to resist disease, and exert yourself for long periods of time. Defines the extent of armor you can wear.
- [[INTELLIGENCE]]: (INT) Mental Power used for memorization, connecting the dots, and the rote strength of many spells. Also determines the amount of [[PREP POINT]]s, halved and rounded down.
- [[WITS]]: (WIT) Mental Precision used for spatial awareness, keeping track of multiple things in space and time, and noticing changes in the environment. Pairs with Dexterity for reacting to events as they're happening.
- [[FOCUS]]: (FOC) Mental Persistence, for dedication to an activity. Retaining awareness and being able to concentrate on maintaining a spell's complexity over periods of time.
- [[WILL]]: (WILL) Spiritual Power, used to inspire, stand out, assert dominance, and subdue creatures.
- [[CONNECTION]]: (CON) Spiritual Precision, used to both disguise and discern intent, as well as to emotionally project and cause the desired change in the feelings of others.
- [[POISE]]: (POI) Spiritual Persistence, used to resist fear, exhaustion, and the manipulations of others, and to continue to appear cool under pressure.

There are also numerous [[SECONDARY]] attributes, derived from the primaries.
- [[EXERTION]]: A pool of Stamina (STA) points that can be drawn on, causing [[EXHAUSTION]] over time. Based on [[PHYSICAL]] attribute total.
- [[MANA CAPACITY]](MP) Energy used to warp reality, often defined as 'spells' or 'magic'. Based on [[MENTAL]] attribute total.
- [[SPIRIT POINTS]]: (SP) An emotional reserve, sometimes called the soul. Spent to more intensely engage others, invoke authority, evoke emotion, or resist pressure. [[SOCIAL]] attribute total, combined and halved, rounded down, determine the maximum SP capacity.
- [[STEADFAST]]: (SFhp) The zeal and enthusiasm that a creature has, which assists in resisting incoming harm. Incoming damage is reduced down to a multiple of your remaining steadfast, and lacking steadfast represents a sort of soft surrender status. [[PERSISTENCE]] attributes, combined and halved, rounded down, determine maximum SFhp capacity.
