(FOC) Mental Persistence [[ATTRIBUTE]], for dedication to an activity. Retaining awareness and being able to concentrate on maintaining a spell's complexity over periods of time.

One of three [[MENTAL]] stats that combine to determine a character's [[MANA CAPACITY]], and one of three [[PERSISTENCE]] stats that are combined and halved, rounded down, to determine a character's [[STEADFAST]] maximum.
If multitasking, Focus is first halved, rounded down, and then the remainder allocated per activity.
