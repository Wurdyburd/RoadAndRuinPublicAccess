Exertion is a resource pool, equal to 10x a character's [[ENDURANCE]] attribute. Spending points from the pool to [[EXERT]] is required for some special abilities, and [[TIRING]] actions.

Make a note of half of the Exertion pool. If a character possesses less than half of their total Exertion, they suffer [[EXHAUSTION]], which inflicts [[BAD LUCK]] on all skill checks and saves.

Exertion can be recovered through [[REST]]ING:
- Taking a [[BREATHER]] recovers missing points equal to the highest die result out of the character's first relevant proficiency, second relevant proficiency, or Endurance. Only the points spent on the last Exert can be recovered, and no more than 100%.
- Spending a short period of time [[AT REST]] allows the character to roll one of their remaining Endurance attribute as a die, based on their Creature Type.
- Each period of sleep (approximately 4hrs) recovers and spends one Endurance. [[GOOD LUCK]], positive advantages toward quality rest, such as well-prepared food, adequate bedding, or high morale, in excess of [[BAD LUCK]], negative circumstances, such as uneven, bumpy, or hard surfaces, wet, cold, poor or no food, illness, or fear, renders the character [[WELL-RESTED]] for the period of rest.

Actions that cost Exertion:
- 1EX / Weight: Flapping to generate or maintain elevation. Gliding does not cost exertion.
- 1EX / Excess unbalanced weight, on tumbling, acrobatics, climbing, or swimming.
- 1EX per Span of uninterrupted activity maintaining a rhythm or flow.
- 

-Flapping to generate or maintain elevation costs Exertion, but gliding doesn't
-Wearing different levels of armor adds an Exertion cost to abilities that would cost exertion, thereby making heavy armor not necessarily slower, but more exhausting
-Sustained Exertion, over a period of time where you can maintain a rhythm or flow, costs you exertion over time and can force you into exhaustion territory, refunding points on a rest
-Higher carry weight costs exertion points as a sustained exertion, but it's the distribution of that weight that gives you a curse penalty on actions using that body part
-EX. a heavy backpack impacts balance

For each threshold of remaining Exertion, gain 2 Bad LUCK.
