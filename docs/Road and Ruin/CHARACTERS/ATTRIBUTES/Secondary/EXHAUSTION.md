Overdrawing on your [[EXERTION]] pool can wear you down, and lead to dangerous situations and mistakes.

For each threshold of remaining Exertion, gain 1 [[DISTRACTED]] stack.

| THRESHOLD | EXHAUSTION | EXAMPLE (ASSUMING 90) |
| --------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Full      | 0          | 90                    |
| 80%       | 1          | 72                    |
| 60%       | 2          | 54                    |
| 40%       | 3          | 36                    |
| 20%       | 4          | 18                    |
| 0%        | 5          | 0                     |


Taking a [[BREATHER]] allows you to recover Exertion points spent on the activity, to a maximum of all but one. This means that, no matter how practiced you are at the task, continuous action will eventually wear you down, and have lasting effects. Becoming [[WELL-RESTED]] recovers an amount of Exertion as well.
