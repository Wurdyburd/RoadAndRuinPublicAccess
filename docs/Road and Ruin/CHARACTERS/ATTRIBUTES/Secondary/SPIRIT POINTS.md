(SP) An emotional reserve, sometimes called the soul. Spent to more intensely engage others, invoke authority, evoke emotion, or resist pressure. [[SOCIAL]] attribute total, combined and halved, rounded down, determine the maximum SP capacity.

Spirit Points represent your emotional health, and can be spent in excess of your remaining points. Each negative threshold represents another stage of [[HOLLOWING]], or 2 Bad [[LUCK]] to Social skill checks per stage. Spending 1SP extra negates a stage of Hollowing.

| STAGE    | EXAMPLE (ASSUMING 3SP)                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Healthy  | 3                                     |
| Empty    | 0                                     |
| x1       | -3                                    |
| x2       | -6                                    |
| x3       | -9                                    |
| x4       | -12                                   |
| Soulless | Only possible via supernatural means. |

Issuing a [[COMMAND]] costs a minimum of 1SP, though with enough training, your followers may intuit your wants, and perform them, without having to issue a command.

Deals with devils and the like may also take SP, often in amounts far in excess of what it would take to become Soulless. It is up to the savvy warlock to try to negotiate a better deal, or substitute this cost somehow.
