There are numerous [[SECONDARY]] attributes, derived from the primaries.
- [[EXERTION]]: A pool of Stamina (STA) points that can be drawn on, causing [[EXHAUSTION]] over time. Based on [[PHYSICAL]] attribute total.
- [[MANA CAPACITY]](MP) Energy used to warp reality, often defined as 'spells' or 'magic'. Based on [[MENTAL]] attribute total.
- [[SPIRIT POINTS]]: (SP) An emotional reserve, sometimes called the soul. Spent to more intensely engage others, invoke authority, evoke emotion, or resist pressure. [[SOCIAL]] attribute total, combined and halved, rounded down, determine the maximum SP capacity.
- [[STEADFAST]]: (SFhp) The zeal and enthusiasm that a creature has, which assists in resisting incoming harm. Incoming damage is reduced down to a multiple of your remaining steadfast, and lacking steadfast represents a sort of soft surrender status. [[PERSISTENCE]] attributes, combined and halved, rounded down, determine maximum SFhp capacity.
