'Size' is an approximation of measurement, kept specific enough to influence game mechanics, but loose enough to not get bogged down by minutia.

Each Size is a range of approximately 1.5ft, or half a meter, rounded to the nearest Size that may actually affect the scenario.

When something is measured as '[[STANDARD]]', it is generally approximate to it's function in the eyes of a human. A sword made for a goblin will be on the shorter side, while a knife made for a giant would be enormous, but Size determines how much damage each does when used effectively.
