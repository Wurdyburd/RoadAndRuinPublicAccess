Mana is considered to be in a form of metaphysical liquid state, swirling about the spirit and soul. Through meditation and ritual, mana can be condensed into a more powerful, yet inflexible form called a Cluster, of 2-5 mana each, over an amount of time equal to your success amount per hour. Clusters can also be dismantled, dissolved into their liquid amount, the same way.

Some spells require clusters of the appropriate size to be cast at all, as the magic is too volatile to be built slowly over time.

Spells that consume a cluster for power use the entirety of a cluster in the casting, but cast in the amount of time that only a single point of mana would require.

Mana clusters may also be tinged with the [[ESSENCE]] of their origin, whether that mana was harvested from a leyline, an element, or a living creature.
