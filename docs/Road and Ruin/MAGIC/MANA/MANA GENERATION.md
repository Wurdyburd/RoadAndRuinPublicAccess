Living creatures replenish an amount of mana at a rate equal to the average of their three [[MENTAL ATTRIBUTE]]s per day, over time.
- If counting in 6-[[SPAN]] days, that comes out to approximately 5% per span, or 30% of total per day.
- EX. A creature with an attribute total of 9 recovers ~3 mana per day, or 1MP/2 Spans.


#### LONG-TERM RULES
If using [[LONG-TERM RULES]], for stories that take place over many days, weeks, months, or even years, decades, or centuries, continue to recover approximately 5% per span.
