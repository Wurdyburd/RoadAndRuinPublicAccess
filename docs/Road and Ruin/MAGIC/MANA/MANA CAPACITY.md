Living creatures, unless otherwise stated, have a maximum [[MANA]] capacity equal to the sum of their three [[MENTAL ATTRIBUTE]]s. This is regardless of the form it takes, and trying to overstock on mana can be dangerous, even damaging, as mana bursts and rips through it's container.

Non-living materials tend to not carry an amount of mana of any real significance, but under the right circumstances, wood, stone, metals, and gems can be made to store mana.

#### LONG-TERM RULES
If using [[LONG-TERM RULES]], for stories that take place over many days, weeks, months, or even years, decades, or centuries, you may multiply the capacity of mana by 10. (9 = 90)
