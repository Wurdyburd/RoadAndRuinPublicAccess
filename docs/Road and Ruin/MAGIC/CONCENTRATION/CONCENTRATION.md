Some spells or activities run the risk of suffering over long periods of time. Rolling a [[FOCUS]] skill check represents the character's ability to apply themselves mentally for a duration, especially on tasks that require their full attention.

Activities that require concentration:
- [[SPELL]]S. Especially without the infrastructure to maintain an [[ENCHANTMENT]], keeping track and timing of many variables can be difficult.
- [[RESEARCH]]. Sifting through so much information can be mentally exhausting. The more tired you are, the more chance you have of skimming past something that you should have noticed.
- [[CRAFTS]]. Fine detail and precision measurements can require intense focus.
- KEEPING WATCH. Long hours where nothing happens, or high stress, can lead to overlooking minor details, such as a distant sound or movement.

Kinds of concentration: 
- [[MAINTAINED CONCENTRATION]]: At the start of each span of time, roll Successfully to maintain the effect to the following round. Failure to maintain concentration may lead to [[BROKEN CONCENTRATION]].
- [[DECAYING CONCENTRATION]]: At the start of each span, roll a new check, taking the lower of the old and new value, as the effectiveness drops. May be a Fail/Succeed/But penalty.
- [[CRESCENDO CONCENTRATION]]: At the start of each span, roll a new concentration check, taking the new value if it's higher, and ending the effect if it's lower. Notably for spells, some effects count the number of rounds a spell was active, called the [[CRESCENDO VALUE]], while others have a [[CRESCENDO FINALE]], or burst, if you choose to end the spell without rolling, which may have benefits earlier in the spell's lifespan.

#### [[BROKEN CONCENTRATION]]
Failure to sustain your concentration doesn't necessarily mean that bad things happen, but it does mean that if something bad DOES happen, it can impact your ability to react based on when you notice, if you even notice at all.

[[DISTRACTED]], suffering damage, and [[DISPEL]] can all negatively impact your concentration, and potentially cause it to fail.

This can lead to spells [[BACKFIRE]], or a penalty to your [[REACTION]] speed, as though you were [[SURPRISED]].
