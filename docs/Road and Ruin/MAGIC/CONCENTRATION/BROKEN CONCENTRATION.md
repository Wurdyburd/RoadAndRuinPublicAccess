Failure to sustain your concentration doesn't necessarily mean that bad things happen, but it does mean that if something bad DOES happen, it can impact your ability to react based on when you notice, if you even notice at all.

[[DISTRACTED]], suffering damage, and [[DISPEL]] can all negatively impact your concentration, and potentially cause it to fail.

This can lead to spells [[BACKFIRE]], or a penalty to your [[REACTION]] speed, as though you were [[SURPRISED]].
