While concentrating on a spell or effect, at the start of each span of time, roll a new concentration check, taking the new value if it's higher, and ending the effect if it's lower.

Notably for spells, some effects count the number of rounds a spell was active, called the [[CRESCENDO VALUE]], while others have a [[CRESCENDO FINALE]], or burst, if you choose to end the spell without rolling, which may have benefits earlier in the spell's lifespan.
