Also called a counterspell, as a special action, a creature who's prepared with the methods to cast a spell may spend a point of mana to attempt to disrupt and unravel the efforts of another spellcaster that they understand is being cast.
In this contested [[CONCENTRATION]] roll, 
- ADDUP: generating a Concentration value above the target's own value ends the spell.
- If the target rolled a 23, and you rolled a 27, the spell would end.
- OUTCOME: reduce the target's Concentration value by an amount equal to your success value, as an additional negative modifier.
- If the target rolled 3 Above, and you rolled 5 Above, the spell would be reduced to Failure. If you rolled 3 Above, the spell would be reduced to Fail But, and 2 Above would reduce the spell to Success But.

Dispelling magic can lead to [[BROKEN CONCENTRATION]] for the caster.
