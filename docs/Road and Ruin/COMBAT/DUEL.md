[[COMBAT]], when not in the midst of a chaotic skirmish, two or more fighters can concentrate on each other, and demonstrate their skill in swordplay.

A duel is considered a [[STAGE]], and may take place alone or in the middle of a much larger skirmish. Each combatant holds defeating the opponent in their [[INTENTION]], and so will become [[DISTRACTED]] if they attempt to shift their focus, which can prove a deadly mistake.

Dueling creatures must make a decision, choosing how they want to approach the fight.
1) Allocate up to 3x your Stamina [[EXERTION]] points, on SPRINT, STRIKE, STRENGTH, EVASION, or FLURRY.
2) Determine who has the [[EDGE]], adding STRIKE, and roll [[INITIATIVE]].
3) Each actor performs their action in order, leading by success threshold: Strike, Anticipate, or Cast.
4) Another actor can react, suffering Distraction for every 5 points of action difference without Anticipating.

### ALLOCATE EXERTION
Creatures in a duel can focus on different facets of the fight, in an attempt to gain an advantage, but doing so is exhausting.
Up to triple your Stamina can be spent in [[EXERTION]] points each round, allocated between different stances:
- EXERTION OF SPRINT: Movement from further range inward, by [[CHARGING]].
- EXERTION OF STRIKE: Adds +1 speed to the [[INITIATIVE]] for exertion equal to the weapon's weight.
- EXERTION OF STRENGTH: Adds +1 weight class to the weapon, increasing it's cost to swing, damage, and armor reduction.
- EXERTION OF EVASION: Adds +1 to evade attempts per half your size in exertion.
- EXERTION OF FLURRY: Planning to make more than one attack. Equals cost for every attack.

### ORDER
When two characters duel, [[INITIATIVE]] is rolled to determine who has the [[EDGE]].
Each character adds together:
- Their Reactive Speed (DEX+WITS)
- Their Preemptive Speed (INT+CON)
- Their proficiency with their weapon
- Their proficiency in the weapon of the opponent
- Any positive difference in Size between the two weapons
- [[EXERTION]] of speed: +1, per amount of exertion equal to the weapon's weight.
Whoever has the higher value has the [[EDGE]], and tilts a 1d10 [[CONTEST]] roll in their favor by the difference.
Whoever wins the contest performs their action that many [[TIME PIP]]S faster than the other.

### STRIKE
If striking, perform an attack as normal. Exertion of Strength reduces enemy armor effectiveness.
### ANTICIPATE
If anticipating, you gain Intention in the move an opponent will make:
#### EVADE ATTACK

#### BLOCK ATTACK

#### ATTACK VULNERABILITY
### CAST




While a duel is a character's [[INTENTION]], they may add the positive difference in weapon [[PROFICIENCY]]

Creatures focused on each other in a [[DUEL]] make a skill check against each other, using their weapon [[PROFICIENCY]] which can add bonus value to the dice roll, but you may become [[DISTRACTED]] by outside events.
