Mysteries are tales of discovery, and revolve entirely around the hook of the unknown.
Characters may be highly specialized toward elements of the specific mystery, or have accidentally stumbled into something unusual on their own, and push it out of curiosity or pressure. they connect the dots of collected clues and evidence to unravel the mystery at the end.

Hosting a Mystery requires providing the player characters with a trail of clues that point toward an apparent truth, but keep the final reveal secret to the very end, possibly through red herrings, and characters who lied.

| THE HOOK       | The mystery is defined by one or more unknowns, such as who did it, what happened, where, how, why, and to who. These questions can come about suddenly, or as the result of more observant characters who noticed something was amiss, and are determined to get to the bottom of things.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| GATHER CLUES   | By seeking out evidence, either in different locations or held by other characters, or following a lead presented by evidence, the characters start to piece together the puzzle of what it is that has transpired here. Sometimes, evidence leads to a dead end, and sometimes it can set you on the wrong path altogether, a 'red herring', that needs to be noticed and reexamined. Once all the available information has been gathered and arranged, it may present a narrative, most commonly defined by a Motive. |
| THE TWIST      | Satisfied that the mystery is solved and wrongs are righted, one final stumbling block appears: something that was once known to be true, is now discovered to have been false, and this new information completely unravels the rest of the theory. But this falsehood is, in itself, a new clue, one that points to the truth when followed.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| MYSTERY SOLVED | Having pursued the twist to its inevitable conclusion, the case is closed. Criminals are behind bars, victims avenged, a device activated, or a puzzle solved, the characters are now free to return to their lives, or push onward to the next adventure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
