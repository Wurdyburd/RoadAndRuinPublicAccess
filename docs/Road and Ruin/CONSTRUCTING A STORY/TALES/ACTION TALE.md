Stories of action are fast and more about achievements than character development, making use of fight scenes, with duels between two characters or each hero fighting off many foes, and examples of skill, where every character is a different specialist, to fill out the diversity of the team and allow each time to shine in the spotlight.

When hosting a Tale of Action, present an end objective that is simple on paper, but seemingly impossible in execution, but must be done, in the name of glory, revenge, money, or to have something returned.
"Easier said than done" should be the target experience, and can cover anything from a car chase, to a bank heist, to a prison break, to a martial arts contest.

| THE INTRODUCTION | Characters meet each other for the first time, or are reunited after some time away from their shared, dramatic past. This is either during, the result of, or leading to the first major action sequence, which should also establish what the OBJECTIVE of the story is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| THE MONTAGE      | Once established, the characters move through a series of challenges, one after another, at a breakneck speed, seemingly unstoppable in their skill and talents. These challenges should be drawn as a result of pass-to-the-next, or draw-from-a-hat order of challenges that are practically tailor-made to be solved by this particular crew. This is a major opportunity for each of the characters to showcase their abilities, and possibly introduce additional elements of their backstory or personality. |
| THE SETBACK      | The characters experience failure or defeat, possibly for the very first time, or a sudden betrayal, or boiling over of conflict between members of the group. Tensions should be raised, and all hope seem lost, as the true scope of their task looms in front of them. Nevertheless, the characters find some shared or personal reason to press on.                                                                                                                                                            |
| THE FINALE       | After another series of challenges, the final objective is now achieved, through skill, a fatal enemy mistake, or even an act of extreme absurdity. The day one, the spoils looted and distributed (maybe), the dead buried, each character either departs the group, or together walks off into the sunset, and on to the possibility of future as-yet-untold adventures.                                                                                                                                         |
ACTION ROLES:
- The Hero: A dashing rogue with a heart of gold. Is usually the glue holding the group together.
- The Antihero: Doesn't want to be in the group. They said so. Plays by their own rules.
- The Romantic: Will often be the voice of reason, or a love interest. De-escalates tensions.
- The Innocent: This may be a member of the crew, or a character picked up along the way. They often have some kind of insight or expertise that's surprisingly helpful, but their VIP nature often means keeping them alive at all costs.
- The Driver: Delivers the crew to scene, master of the getaway vehicle and chase scene, probably can drive anything. Alternatively, the guy who knows a guy to get you in.
- The Heavy: Uses weapons. Big ones. They usually don't care what the mission is, so long as they get to use those weapons.
- The Sniper: Precision artisan, meticulous, calculating. Is often perceived as less trustworthy than the others.
- The Acrobat: A ninja in just about every sense of the word, they bring a graceful flair to what otherwise amounts to gratuitous violence.
- The Loose Cannon: Sometimes a demolitions expert, their somewhat unhinged enthusiasm is prone to getting them, and everyone around them, into trouble.
ACTION MECHANICS:
- Big Bomber: A single item or payoff strategy can be built up or acquired over the adventure, which will instantaneously succeed one skill check scenario, guaranteed, with flying colors.
- Brute Force: Problems and obstacles that should ordinarily not be solvable with violence, are. Driving through walls, shooting blast doors shut, launching via explosions, etc.
- Tis a Fleshwound: None of the injuries acquired during the adventure are lethal for long.
