A story, mechanically, is often comprised of two major variables: [[TALE]], and [[ROLE]].

Tales are storytelling structures produce a predictable framework of connect-the-dots events for storytellers who may be unfamiliar with the patterns and tropes of a specific genre, whereas Roles represent a categorical umbrella of sorts, a collection of actions and skills that help to move the story forward.

In terms of WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, and HOW,
- Tales represent the WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, and WHY
- Roles represent the WHO, and HOW

# TYPES OF TALES

While there as many different stories as there are stars in the night sky, Road and Ruin aims to condense certain patterns and tropes down to both a predictable framework, and reliable twists.

Different kinds of Tales cover different story genres, from Action, Mystery, Intrigue, and Horror, and can be used in multiple different settings, whether your adventure is in mud-soaked medieval Fantasy, space-faring Sci-Fi, or beleaguered Modern Day.

## - [[ACTION TALE]]
Stories of action are fast and more about achievements than character development, making use of fight scenes, with duels between two characters or each hero fighting off many foes, and examples of skill, where every character is a different specialist, to fill out the diversity of the team and allow each time to shine in the spotlight.

When hosting a Tale of Action, present an end objective that is simple on paper, but seemingly impossible in execution, but must be done, in the name of glory, revenge, money, or to have something returned.
"Easier said than done" should be the target experience, and can cover anything from a car chase, to a bank heist, to a prison break, to a martial arts contest.

ROLES: The Hero, The Antihero, The Romantic, The Innocent, The Driver, The Heavy, The Sniper, The Acrobat, The Loose Cannon
MECHANICS: Big Bomber, Brute Force, Tis a Fleshwound
## - [[MYSTERY]] TALES
Mysteries are tales of discovery, and revolve entirely around the hook of the unknown.
Characters may be highly specialized toward elements of the specific mystery, or have accidentally stumbled into something unusual on their own, and push it out of curiosity or pressure. they connect the dots of collected clues and evidence to unravel the mystery at the end.

Hosting a Mystery requires providing the player characters with a trail of clues that point toward an apparent truth, but keep the final reveal secret to the very end, possibly through red herrings, and characters who lied.

## - [[MOVIE MONSTER]] TALES
Monster movies, or Slashers, borrow a lot of elements from both Action and Horror. Characters will often have no idea as to the danger they're falling into, not before it's too late, and then every moment becomes a terrifying struggle for survival.

Slashers are less about maintaining a narrative, and more about nurturing an atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Whatever's out to get the characters is often larger than life, with supernatural or alien powers, and recurringly performs feats that seem impossible. Slashers have the lowest survival rate of Tales, with a high possibility that the entire cast dies long before they ever see the sun again.

ROLES: The Innocent, The Frontliner, The Engineer, The Scholar
MECHANICS: Tick Tock, Lost Heartbeat, Tavern Brawling
