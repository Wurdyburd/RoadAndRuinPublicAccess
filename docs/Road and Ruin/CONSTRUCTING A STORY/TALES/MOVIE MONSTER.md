Monster movies, or Slashers, borrow a lot of elements from both Action and Horror. Characters will often have no idea as to the danger they're falling into, not before it's too late, and then every moment becomes a terrifying struggle for survival.

Slashers are less about maintaining a narrative, and more about nurturing an atmosphere of fear and paranoia. Whatever's out to get the characters is often larger than life, with supernatural or alien powers, and recurringly performs feats that seem impossible. Slashers have the lowest survival rate of Tales, with a high possibility that the entire cast dies long before they ever see the sun again.

| CHAPTER                | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| EVERYTHING SEEMED FINE | Hints and tells that something is amiss are present almost at the very beginning of the story, but with no reason to be suspicious or be keen to analyze random oddities, the characters push on, none the wiser. It's only when it's too late to back out, do they finally realize that they're trapped in a spider's web, that very much wants them dead.                                                                                    |
| MONSTER DO             | While the characters move from location to location, shoring up defenses, making repairs, and trying to accumulate enough Discovery successes to be allowed to leave, the monster is on the prowl. It'll use whatever means at it's disposal to track, stalk, ambush, chase, and destroy.                                                                                                                                                      |
| WHO TRAPPED WHO        | After becoming familiar with the layout of the Theatre and it's various stages, it's time to set traps, rig distractions, or heft a really, really big weapon. This cinematic head is the most dangerous thus far, and someone may have to sacrifice themselves just to create a last opportunity for anyone to escape alive. There may even be a false end, where things seem resolved, but the slasher miraculously surges back to the fore. |
| ESCAPE TO DAYLIGHT     | With the monster trapped or dead behind them, any surviving characters stumble back to a place of relative safety. They may tell others about their tale, or arm up just to come back and finish the job for good, but that's mostly beyond the scope of this tale.                                                                                                                                                                            |
MONSTER ROLES:
- THE INNOCENT: This may be a member of the crew, or a character picked up along the way. They often have some kind of insight or expertise that's surprisingly helpful, but their VIP nature often means keeping them alive at all costs.
- THE FRONTLINER: This role is often a headstrong militant type. Their first, and often only strategy is to attack the monster head-on, shooting it, running it over, or stabbing it. Beyond that, they'll try to stay armed, more out of habit than for any real effectiveness against the enemy. The rest of the team can choose to give some of their cards to the Frontliner, in the hopes that they'll take the lead, and that those cards will actually amount to something.
- THE ENGINEER: A specialist through and through, the Engineer proves their worth in the field, juryrigging resources, repairing broken engines or opening doors. Extremely practical, their efforts give the crew an enormous leg up in terms of turning their environment around, so that it doesn't work against them so badly. Turns active penalties, such as darkness, into advantages.
- THE SCHOLAR: Their interests are almost purely academic, but they're usually just as fascinated by their circumstances as they are terrified of the danger. They'll whip up strategies, and produce various invaluable nuggets of trivia that means the crew won't have to rely on guessing as much. Using devices, and batteries, they can replicate any other role, but only once.
MONSTER MECHANICS:
- TICK TOCK: Whenever a span of time occurs, such as searching for clues, entering a room, or hiding, roll a d20. On a 20, the monster appears; if not, the threshold drops by 1. On an appearance, a successful Perception/Initiative check may grant the party an opportunity to do something first.
- LOST HEARTBEAT: Rather than health, a standard deck of playing cards is doled out to the party, shuffled and face down. Whenever the monster appears, whoever gets attacked, either the Frontliner or someone at random, reveal cards one at a time until a red card is revealed, indicating that, somehow, this time, the character has survived. If no red cards have been revealed and the character runs out of cards, that character has been killed. Alternatively, as per Discovery rules, revealing the correlation value of multiple cards indicates how many red cards you must reveal to stay alive.
- TAVERN BRAWLING: When the Frontliner is attacked by the monster, they can fight back, using a brand new, situationally relevant method of driving the creature off that hasn't been used before. If this skill check is successful, they only reveal the top card of their Lost Heartbeat deck, or one red card, rather than cards until red or as many red cards as the creature dealt damage.
