Rules for Searching: 
- When searching for a specific thing, you do Investigation proficiency checks, and generate successes per span of time
- Each success has you draw a card, and each repository of checks has a maximum number of cards that can be drawn; your skill essentially just dictates the speed at which you process the data
- Each card has either No Correlation, Some Correlation, or Strong Correlation with the subject at hand; in this case, "Is there a secret door?" Cards like The Gate would be strong, whereas cards like The Mask might be weak, and cards like The Forge would be nothing 
- Each time you add Correlation to the situation, (0/1/2), you roll a d20: On a 21, minus the amount of correlation you've added, you find a secret door. But on a 1-2, +2 for each attempt you've rolled, you become convinced that there is no secret door, and that continuing is pointless
- "Clues" can be discovered, adding 1-5 to the threshold of success, based on the value of the clue. For example, a map that has a mark that suggests there's a secret door in a specific room, but doesn't describe where or how, might be a Q2 clue
