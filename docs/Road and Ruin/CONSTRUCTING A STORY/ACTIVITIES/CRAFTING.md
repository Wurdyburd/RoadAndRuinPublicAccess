There will be scenarios where a character doesn’t have the right tool for the job at hand, dreams about creating the perfect weapon, or seeks to shape the world around them.

Crafting always requires the use of at least one material, such as wood, stone, harvested plant and animal parts, metals, and chemicals, and usually at least one tool, like a knife, a hammer, chisel, awl, clippers, and other component materials such as adhesives or acids.

It may seek to combine multiple ingredients, harvest ingredients, repair something, or build something outright. Each time a material is used, the limit of Crafting successes to shape the final result is defined by the Quality of the material, which may describe either the rarity or the purity of the material in question.

### CRAFTING DISCIPLINES

Crafting of certain materials requires a distinct specialization before it can be used, representing training in a [[DISCIPLINE]] that general handiness can’t transcend.

Examples of these include Blacksmithing for iron and steel, Redsmithing for copper and bronze, and Greensmithing for living wood and bone.

### CRAFTING TRAITS

Traits, when used in reference to crafting materials, refer to a number of different attributes that a material may have. Different materials may have the same trait, but different effectiveness of them. When seeking an opportunity to craft, you may simply wish to name a trait you wish to pursue, rather than a specific item that you carry. For example, instead of using glue for an adhesive, you could use any sticky substance, such as tree sap.

Some example Crafting Traits:
