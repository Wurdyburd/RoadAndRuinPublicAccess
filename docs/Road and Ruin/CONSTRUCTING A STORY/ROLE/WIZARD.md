A researcher and studier of mana, in all it's forms. You prioritize learning, in subjects either broad, deep, or both. Limited only by your keen mind and power supply, you understand that knowledge is the greatest treasure.

Wizards' great mental intellect means their predilection for puzzles and mastery of magic often go hand in hand. While not necessarily bordering on obsession, you're defined by your keen interests, that drive you to places, people, and things, and never stop being interesting for you.





Some proficiencies that may help you:

| NAME                                                        | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ARTIFACTS and [[GESTURE]]**                               | These devices provide the catalyst for both the casting of spells, and the enchanted tool that makes quick work of reliable circumstances, and the right hand gestures can act as an amplifier in their own right.                                                              |
| [[RESEARCH]], [[INSIGHT]], and [[INVESTIGATION]]            | Not just purely academic, the ability to know how to pursue the knowledge and discoveries you desire is crucial for actually doing so.                                                                                                                                          |
| [[CIVILIZATION]] and [[LANGUAGES]]                          | While the eccentric hermit cannot be discounted, much in the way of magic and learning comes from the discoveries and advancements of others, both in present day, and in ancient civilizations. The more you know about them and how they record that information, the better. |
| [[ATTUNEMENT]], [[CHANNELING]], [[GRIMOIRE]], and [[RUNES]] | Being able to detect, identify, harness, and direct all varieties of magic gives you a vast flexibility in many situations.                                                                                                                                                     |
| [[CRAFTS]], [[HARVEST]], and [[HERBALISM]]                  | Sometimes, the construction and processing of new equipment is necessary to pursue a line of thinking, prove a theory, or implement it into regular practice. Being responsible for your own equipment and supplies cuts out the need for a middleman.                          |

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME              | REASON                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SPELL DIP         | If playing a spellcaster, the first ranks of each Tag represent several diverse spells, that can help with exploration, experiments, and more. |
| THRYSIAN ADDENDUM | Powerful, if restrained, spells and features for enchantments and amplifications work to empower a Wizard's best efforts.                      |
| THRYSIAN REVISION | When your best efforts aren't enough, spells that change the narrative entirely are the next best thing.                                       |
| ARCANE ARSENAL    | Beyond spell weaponization, enchantment tech and more powerful tool use makes your sorcerous powers have a much longer lasting benefit.        |
| FLORAL FLOURISH   | Beyond alchemical herbalism, these spells have powerful effects when used on others and yourself, manipulating moods.                          |
Playing a Wizard is about having an intellectual pursuit. Delving into dungeons for lost knowledge or artifacts, meeting with specialists and discussing research with peers, and mastering the equipment associated with your field, are all ways that a Wizard might plan their day-to-day. There's little doubt that you understand any risks involved, but that doesn't mean you won't push past them in pursuit of your interests, especially if the opportunity appears limited.
