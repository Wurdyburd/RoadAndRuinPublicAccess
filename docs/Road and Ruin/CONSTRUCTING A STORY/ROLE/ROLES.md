ROLES represent an approximation of how much each build's abilities help it contribute to different types of game content, as well as operates as a jumping-off point for campaign groups to determine which kinds of content they would like to experience, and which they would rather leave out.

| -------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **🗺️ ** | [[EXPLORER]]       | You want to travel the world! Whether wandering quiet forest paths, scaling mountain heights, traveling to the sea, or to visit far-flung ruins or cities, you manifest the true spirit of adventure.                                                            |
| **🔍**   | **[[DUNGEONEER]]** | You like to use your wit to solve puzzles, outmaneuver your enemies, squeeze through narrow gaps, and uncover ancient mysteries and treasures. With rope and map and torch and ration, you brave the spaces too dangerous for any other.                         |
| **📚**   | **[[WIZARD]]**     | A researcher and studier of mana, in all its forms, you prioritize learning different spells for different purposes. Limited only by your keen mind and power supply, you understand knowledge is the greatest treasure.                                         |
| **⚔️**   | **[[WARRIOR]]**    | You crave the thrill of battle above all else, whether by sheer muscle, incredible swordsmanship, or simply in a sudden moment of danger. You want to dominate your foes, defend the innocent, or get a really cool trophy and story for the tavern.             |
| **🛠️**  | **[[CRAFTER]]**    | One's limits can often be overcome by simply using the right tool for the job, and those with better tools, overcome them faster, easier, and with better results. You source your materials, and put in the time, effort, and skill to produce wondrous works.  |
| **🕶️**  | **[[SNEAKRET]]**   | You want to achieve your goals having made as little ripples as possible. Heists, assassinations, disguises, and keeping to the shadows are all tools you employ.                                                                                                |
| **🗣️**  | **[[SOCIALITE]]**  | You want to meet new people, to hear their dreams and woes, and gain perspective through the eyes of another. You know that it's not the Where that matters in a story, but the Who, and the Why.                                                                |
| **👑**   | **[[COMMANDER]]**  | Your rousing speeches inspire the masses, your orders swiftly followed by your fellow crew, and loyal pets are carefully trained to work in tandem with your efforts. You want to be a leader, a strategist, or a beast-tamer, for there is strength in numbers. |
| **👁️**  | **[[RITUALIST]]**  | Power need not stem from years of training or intensive learning; sometimes, all you need is a deal. Contracts struck with fae or daemon, or devotions to your god, place in hand a power not entirely your own.                                                 |
