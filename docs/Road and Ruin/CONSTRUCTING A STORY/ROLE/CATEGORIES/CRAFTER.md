One's limits can often be overcome by simply using the right tool for the job, and those with better tools, overcome them faster, easier, and with better results. You source your materials, and put in the time, effort, and skill to produce wondrous works, marvelous efficiency, and well-sourced materials with high-grade properties.

Craftspeople are some of the most pragmatic of the roles, building their way out of problems, constructing solutions. Their talents may be renowned, or simply an honest-day's work, a means to an end. With an eye for detail, craftsfolk are usually responsible for sourcing their own materials, especially if it's something they specialize in, but may go far and wide in the search for just the right element for a masterwork production. They may be in service to a greater cause, or isolated in their arts, but at the end of the day, all have a passion for what they do.

Craftspeople are often defined be their [[DISCIPLINE]], specialists in techniques and skills that don't come quickly to others, or naturally. It is often far more efficient to seek one out who is capable of performing the service you require, than to spend months, sometimes years or decades, attempting to collect the skills and knowledge that craftsfolk can summon at a moment's notice.

Voice and body language are as much a piece of a performer's product as their script or song, and a foreman needs the capacity to wield his men as efficiently as his own arms. Those who work with plants or animals or their byproducts will need skills for that, and enchanters will need to be competent about their instruments. |

| SQUAD TACTICS                                    | Being a craftsman often means being relied on for your talents, but you aren't infallible, and for all you can do, there are many other skills you don't possess. Being able to effectively distribute labor, and make the most of your allies' efforts, can make your life a lot easier. |
Characters who are Crafters tend to be opinionated. There is often a right answer to a situation or problem, some tool or technique that's considered standard, or something you scoff at and blow off, since your way is better. How your character came to be a specialist, and how they treat others outside their profession, are often just as important as exactly what it is you practice.
