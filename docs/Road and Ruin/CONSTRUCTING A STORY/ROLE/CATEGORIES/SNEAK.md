You want to achieve your goals, having made as little ripples as possible. Heists, assassinations, disguises, and keeping to the shadows are all tools you employ.

Conflict resolution need not actually involve conflict. It's loud, messy, and gets everywhere. Sometimes, it's better for everyone involved if nobody knows what you're actually up to. Get in, move some things around, put some things where they aren't supposed to be, take some things with you, forge a signature, poison a drink, trap the door, and get out, with no one the wiser.

Sneaks are independent, the more often and longer, the better. That's not to say they won't team up, but there's usually a respectful distance that's maintained. You're usually good at what you do, real good, enough to not have to rely on anybody else, but rely you do: someone has to fence your goods, someone pays your fees. Otherwise, you'd be reduced to nothing but a common thief.


Some proficiencies that may help you:

| NAME                                                      | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| [[STEALTH]]                                               | The obvious pick for consistently shielding your location from outside observers.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[DECEPTION]], [[PERSUASION]], [[SEDUCTION]], [[EMPATHY]] | Walk right in the front door. Sometimes, all you need is to shake the right hands, and say the right words to the right people.                                                                                                                              |
| [[ATHLETICS]], [[BALANCE]], [[DRIFT]], [[HAULING]]        | Other times, you need to perform a bit of second-story work. Performing some gymnastics to get over walls, up to windows, through narrow passages, and down ropes, all while lugging gear in and anything from loot to entire people out, would tax anybody. |
| [[STRATEGY]], [[PERFORM]], [[PRESENCE]], [[CIVILIZATION]] | And sometimes, none of this is even your job. You're the tactician, or the distraction, and you can rely on other members of your sneaky crew to do the job you need them to.                                                                                |
|                                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME                | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                |

| NIMBLE FINGERS      | Many skills for the swift of hand represent a wide array of opportunities: picking locks or picking pockets, prying valuables from sconces.                                           |
| TRAPPINGS OF GIRETH | For prying secrets from voice and mind, the talent for both predicting behavior, and influencing it, cannot be understated.                                                           |
| CONCEALED WEAPONRY  | Not always about coming to blows, the ability to produce a solution quickly and deliver it effectively and without personal risk can be powerful in strategies and emergencies alike. |
| CLOAKED IN SHADOW   | Much of stealth takes place in the dark. Folding the shadows around you, and plucking valuable shadows from heels, means your stealth can travel with you.                            |
| SQUAD TACTICS       | A den of thieves and cutthroat murderers will come together, for as long as honor allows, to execute more elaborate plans, and reap greater rewards.                                  |

Despite their solitary nature, Sneaks do have things they care about, but a thief who would steal is the most paranoid of being stolen from. They may be first hesitant, then reluctant, and even fiercely resistant to having what they know and care for known by others, lest this knowledge be used against them, their belongings stolen from them, their allies abandon them, their power in tatters. What will you do, to achieve your goals? What are you willing to risk? What do you refuse to lose?

### AWARENESS
Before entering into an unknown location, players should question what degree they intend to be on the lookout for traps, dangers, and enemy contacts.
Awareness is an Intention, representing an active bonus to PERCEPTION, CONCENTRATION, and detection of things that you're looking for, and an active penalty to your speed and awareness of things that fall outside your chosen Awareness range or Intention, of an equal amount, up to a maximum based on your Focus.

For example, you could maintaining concentration on a Cast Light spell, or search for signs of traps or hidden enemies, but performing both means less value for each, and a higher chance of not only being surprised by an ambush, but losing your hold on your light source as well.
