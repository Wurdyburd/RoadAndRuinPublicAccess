You like to use your wit to solve puzzles, outmaneuver your enemies, squeeze through narrow gaps, and uncover ancient mysteries and treasures. With rope and map and torch and ration, you brave the spaces too dangerous for any other.

As a Dungeoneer, you want a sense of discovery and accomplishment on a smaller, more localized scale. Combat, puzzles, traps, and treasure are all important components to dungeons, but knowing which to specialize in, by how much, and why, will make your dungeon experiences more interesting.

Some proficiencies that may help you:

| NAME                                                                          | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [[GEAR PROFICIENCY]]                                                        | Making sure to come prepared means making sure you come armed and armored! There are dangerous people, beasts, and monsters out there, and sometimes the best solution is good offense and defense. |
| [[ATHLETICS]], [[BALANCE]], and [[HAULING]]                                   | Running for your life, keeping calm when scaling heights, and having the back strength to lift rubble and treasure alike will be a great boon to an adventurer.                                     |
| [[PERCEPTION]], [[ENTRAPMENT]], [[MANIPULATION]], and [[SOMATOSENSE]]         | give you a strong foundation in noticing small details which could otherwise prove fatal, by accident or by design.                                                                                 |
| [[CIVILIZATION]], [[INSIGHT]], [[INVESTIGATION]], [[LANGUAGE]], [[RESEARCH]] | are all powerful tools in a historian's toolkit. Being able to know what the people who lived here were thinking can be a great shortcut in figuring out what to do, and how to do it!              |
| [[CRAFTS]], [[HERBALISM]], [[MEDICINE]], and [[SPIRITUALISM]]                 | are tools to help you source missing supplies, and properly handle haunted ruins.                                                                                                                   |

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME                     | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[MARTIAL WEAPONRY]]** | In the narrow confines of caves and tunnels, quickly-striking simple medium weaponry can ensure that you're versatile enough for any situation, and never be caught by surprise.                         |
| **FORTRESS GUARD**       | In the same way, you can use claustrophobic spaces to your advantage defensively.                                                                                                                        |
| **SQUAD TACTICS**        | Basic teamwork synergy between a group of diverse specialists can be the difference between an everyone-for-themselves disaster, and a well-oiled machine.                                               |
| **ARCANE ARSENAL**       | On top of weaponizing your magics, several academic skills assist in handling anything magical you may come across.                                                                                      |
| **TRAPPINGS OF GIRETH**  | Both detecting and disarming traps, and making use of your own, can be an effective skill for getting out of a dungeon alive, along with some special tricks, should you be willing to deal with devils. |
When playing a Dungeoneer, there's always something that compelled you or drove you to this place. Insatiable curiosity, a research expedition, the promise of lost treasure, or even a paycheck, the former fitting the bill for the latter. A realistic respect for danger along with a certain level of expertise combine to form a Dungeoneer, helping to keep you on your toes and avoid unnecessary risk, but never hold you back from what needs doing and what you came here for.

### AWARENESS
Before entering into an unknown location, players should question what degree they intend to be on the lookout for traps, dangers, and enemy contacts.
Awareness is an Intention, representing an active bonus to PERCEPTION, CONCENTRATION, and detection of things that you're looking for, and an active penalty to your speed and awareness of things that fall outside your chosen Awareness range or Intention, of an equal amount, up to a maximum based on your Focus.

For example, you could maintaining concentration on a Cast Light spell, or search for signs of traps or hidden enemies, but performing both means less value for each, and a higher chance of not only being surprised by an ambush, but losing your hold on your light source as well.
