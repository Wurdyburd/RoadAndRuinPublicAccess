You want to travel the world! Whether wandering quiet forest paths, scaling mountain heights, traveling to the sea, or to visit far-flung ruins or cities, you manifest the true spirit of adventure.

As an Explorer, your games often involve the widest array of content, in terms of both geographical scale and the meaningfulness of what you find within it.

Some proficiencies that may help you:

| [[ATHLETICS]], [[BALANCE]], and [[DRIFT]]             | Keeping your balance is important, especially if you're expecting to go running, jumping, climbing, swimming, and more in nature's personal junglegym.                                                                                                                              |

| [[HUSBANDRY]] and [[COMMANDING]]                      | are your best skills for managing an animal companion, horse, or packmule as you travel.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [[CIVILIZATION]], [[LANGUAGE]], and [[RESEARCH]]     | give you the tourist guide to thriving cities, ancient runes, and anybody you'll happen to meet along the way.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| [[DECEPTION]], [[INSIGHT]], [[CRAFTS]], and [[TASTE]] | will give you confidence in marketplaces and bazaars the world over, knowing when to avoid a shady deal, and bagging the best bargains and rare finds.                                                                                                                              |

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME                       | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[MARTIAL WEAPONRY]]**   | Being armed and having the confidence to use your weapon of choice will help ward off cutpurses and cutthroats alike, as well as some more dangerous wild animals.                                      |
| **SQUAD TACTICS**          | It's never much fun travelling alone, and your comrades will be thankful for your dedication to teamwork and sharing workloads.                                                                         |

| **FLORAL FLOURISH**        | will guarantee that whether for food, safety, or pure sensation, you'll get to revel in every new experience, and your entire spice cabinet.                                                            |
| **SPHERE OF VENUS**        | is full of skills getting the most out of a vibrant life and finding meaning in community. But watch out! Tourists in other planes will find themselves in more alien circumstances than are preferred. |

Playing an Explorer is about looking for an escape, either from a dreary origin or a troubled past, or in pursuit of greener pastures. While you may have a reason that brought you here, the thrill of adventure and intrigue of discovery can easily push you into new environments and encounters, and you tend to be more open-minded to all the strange and myriad ways for a person to be.

### REGION
Different regions of the world sport different people, flora and fauna, history, and locations of interest. Techniques for travel in one area may not be applicable to another region, due to changes in weather and temperature, different languages, impassable terrain or water features. Be sure to take the right equipment for the journey!


| ACTIVITY         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |                         |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| NAVIGATION       | Use skill checks to try to steer the group closer toward your destination. Requires an extended Intelligence or Wits skill check, usually with Survival proficiency, assisted by Scouting success as a Help modifier, if proficient. Renders the players Lost if the requisite number of successes per distance is not met. Being waylaid by poor directions, or navigating around hazards and obstacles, decreases the number of successes.                                               | AUTOPSY                 |
| SCOUTING         | Use of a character's speed and Perception to move ahead of the main group, discovering landmarks to recenter on, and upcoming hazards to either avoid or prepare for.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | BREACH                  |
| SCAVENGING       | Having a character travel with the group, or to either side offroad, on the lookout for wild fruits, vegetables, medicinal herbs, or wild game, and procuring it for provisions. Birds and animals may be scared off by travelling too close to the main group, but being too far off the side can lead to reduced maximum movement, and being left behind. Scouts can assist by relaying what they've seen, as a Help modifier if they are also proficient in identifying wild valuables. | CAMPING                 |
| DRIVING          | A character who ensures the safety of a cart of supplies, associated pack animals, or escorted characters. Their mastery of Animal Husbandry proves invaluable at keeping animals calm and collected, as is their ability to placate any more civilized companions on their long journey. Their low speed represents the baseline for the trip, as Scouts and Scavengers must be able to outpace them to perform their duties.                                                             | CLEAR ROOM<br>          |
| GUARDING         | Keeping combat-capable warriors and wizards nearby , acting as a powerful deterrent ready and waiting to leap to the defense of the group and their charges. Scouts can assist in avoiding becoming Surprised by an ambush, as a Help modifier with their Perception proficiency.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | CONSTRUCTION            |
| BOOST MORALE     | While not immune to wind and rain, merciless sun and driving snow, having a member of the group play music, sing songs, and entertain with conversation helps to keep morale high, and pace steady. Without this in occasional supply, a group becomes irritable, and may become complacent in their duties.                                                                                                                                                                               | COOKING                 |
