Power need not stem from years of training or intensive learning; sometimes, all you need is a deal. Contracts struck with fae or demon, or rewards for your devotion to a god, place in hand a power not entirely your own.

Ritualists are solve their problems with other people's power, as a kind of blend of [[SAGE]] and [[COMMANDER]]. They may meet and broker (what seems like) a fair deal, or pledge their unwavering loyalty to a master, or even summon an entity, only to bind it to their will.

Commonly, power will be either seized through sheer force of will, chaining an entity to your soul, and terrorizing it into submission, requesting an audience with a being to beseech it's mercy, or calling upon a devil, to offer some kind of trade, or [[BARGAINING]]. Doing these things typically costs Spirit Points, as does wielding the creature's power in it's stead.


Some proficiencies that may help you:

| NAME                                                                                  | REASON                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[BINDING]], [[COMMANDING]], [[CHANNELING]], [[SPIRITUALISM]]                         | These skills are used often to come to an accord with and apply the powers of a greater being, whether they want you to, or you want them to.              |
| [[RESEARCH]], [[CIVILIZATION]], [[RUNES]], [[LANGUAGE]]                              | Not every creature speaks your language! Better to do some reading on your chosen patron, so as to avoid any embarrassing gaffs and bad first impressions. |
| [[INSIGHT]], [[DECEPTION]], [[ENTRAPMENT]]                                            | Both to deceive your chosen entity into agreeing to terms that benefit you, as well as to ensure that you aren't being similarly swindled.                 |
| [[INTIMIDATION]], [[PERSUASION]], [[MEDIATION]], [[PRESENCE]], [[TASTE]], [[PERFORM]] | Many different strategies work on many kinds of creatures.                                                                                                 |
| [[STRATEGY]]                                                                          | Knowing what you need a creature's power for, before you actually use it, can make negotiations much smoother.                                             |

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME                | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| TRAPPINGS OF GIRETH | Even if you don't ally with Gireth specifically, the spider demon takes great interest in the same skills used by Ritualists in the first place. Take care that his offers don't seem too tempting, though. |
| ARCANE ARSENAL      | Weaponizing various powers, as well as the ability to contain the power of spirits in enchanted items.                                                                                                      |
| WILDERMANN          | To benefit from the powers of the spirits of nature, you'll have to go to where the wild things are.                                                                                                        |
| FLORAL FLOURISH     | Many of these spells are fae in origin to begin with. Asking one to cast on your behalf only makes sense, and you'll be more entertaining in the petition.                                                  |
| ANY SPELL           | It's easier to direct spirits to do what you ask, if you know how to do it yourself, and just ask them to foot the bill.                                                                                    |

As a Ritualist, there's usually some lofty goal or philosophy you believe in, but which is either out of mortal reach, or that you believe it is, without supernatural assistance. Consider whether you actively worship a single deity, research into diablerie to contract specific demons without falling prey to their manipulations, or whether you can casually converse with the spirits of the dead, and gain the insight of the ancestors. A Brazen Bull is many times more powerful than a Lesser Imp, but is many times harder to bind and keep under control, but control isn't of concern when you loose it into enemy lines. What is your objective? What are you willing to lose in the process?


### FAVOR
Favor represents a variety of things. Proficiency, specialization, a blood pact, destiny, or the blessings of the gods could all be used to represent favor, but within the game of Road and Ruin, [[FAVOR]] is used as a point system to indicate that you have a social resource, much like Reputation, that can be exchanged for powers, goods, and services.
