You want to meet new people, to hear their hopes, their dreams, their woes, and gain perspective through the eyes and lives of others. You know that it's not the Where that matters in a story, but the Who, and the Why.

Socialites are busybodies and social butterflies, but they are far from shallow. Indeed, it's because they find others so interesting and different, that they elate in the opportunity to meet new people. What does Person X, think about Thing Y? Where have they gone, what have they seen? What makes them happy, and what happens when we get many happy people together?

Conflicts can arise between individuals, which can then be solved by individuals. Politics and business alike are a many-layered bouquet of extravagant emotions, experiences, and reason, a story a diamond with as many facets as there are people in it.

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME                | REASON                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FLORAL FLOURISH     | For many, the novelty of an experience is everything. For others, their familiarity. Learning to manage motivations helps you deliver a good time.                     |
| THRYSIAN ADDENDUM   | Amplifying impacts and orating accomplishments are great ways to get your reputation to precede you.                                                                   |
| THRYSIAN REVISION   | And, when you commit a social gaff, or have a case of the wrong place, wrong time, a wave of the wand can make the problem be gone.                                    |
| TRAPPINGS OF GIRETH | In a game of crowns, mastery of the social landscape means as many friends in high places, as low ones. Gather knowledge, and twist for greatest effect.               |
| SQUAD TACTICS       | Not all that's tactical is violent. Having a strong network of allies, whether as your front man or wing man, can produce results greater than the sum of their parts. |

As always, making a character begs the question, what is it that you truly want, but for a Socialite, the answer lies in what others want, often, and widely. You may fight on a different battlefield, one where the pen is mightier than the sword, of ink stains, not blood splatters, and where the scars carved in parchment by quills are as deep as the ones inflicted by a blade. You may fight for your family and friends, for your honor, for the future of your nation or your business, or to smite your competitors, and reign supreme, doing what you wish, and taking what you please. Some may question the cost, but then, what is the cost, should you do nothing?


### SOCIAL NETWORK
The summary of a character's interactions with other entities, people, and the organizations tha they form can be described as their Social Network. Social Networks are defined mechanically as a combination of your Reputation, and Interests.

#### REPUTATION
A character's level of respect, trust, and overall renown or fame with an individual or organization. 
Reputation can grant you a bonus in social situations where it may be applicable, such as convincing someone to do something for you, or the value you possess. It can be gambled, by asking someone to take a chance on you, and lost, by failing to live up to the expectations that others have placed on you.

#### INTERESTS
A character's personal investments include people, places, things, events, hobbies, or ideas, and represent things that the character has an opinion about.
Interests are defined by both the depths of the character's enthusiasm for the subject, as well as their willingness to share about it.
This can be either a positive enthusiasm, of which the character is excited to participate and is something that gives them hope, joy, or meaning, or a negative hatred for the subject, causing the character to have a profound distaste and aggression toward those who enjoy or side with the subject, or inversely, having a backwards appreciation towards others who dislike the subject as much as they do.

Characters whose Interests align may be able to pry into each other more, as though they have a higher Reputation with each other, using their shared interest or hatred as a segue into other topics.
