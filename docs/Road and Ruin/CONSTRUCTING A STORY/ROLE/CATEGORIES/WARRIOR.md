You crave the thrill of battle above all else, whether by sheer muscle, incredible swordsmanship, explosive sorceries, or simply experiencing a sudden moment of danger. You want to dominate your foes, defend the innocent, or get a really cool trophy and a story for the tavern.

Warriors come in many shapes and sizes, but all find themselves squarely in the heat of conflict, and present a surprising knack for staying alive despite decidedly lethal challenges. Each may have their own unique style, all are definably oozing with skill, but what they fight for is what gets them back onto the field, time and time again.


Some proficiencies that may help you:

| NAME                                                          | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [[GEAR PROFICIENCY]]                                        | Weapons, armor, and artifacts make up the bulk of easy ways you can both defend and destroy.                                                                                                                             |
| [[ATHLETICS]], [[HAULING]], and [[RIDE]] and [[HUSBANDRY]]    | Few travel to a battle empty-handed, and the more you carry, the more tired you get. The more tired you get, the easier you are to kill, so figure out how to carry more for longer, or pack up a horse.                 |
| [[ENTRAPMENT]], [[PERCEPTION]], [[INSIGHT]], and [[STRATEGY]] | There are many devious tactics in war, and knowing your enemy is half the battle. Not only devising your own strategies, but recognizing your foe's, is key to decisive victories.                                       |
| [[COMMANDING]], [[INTIMIDATION]], and [[PRESENCE]]            | are all instrumental in controlling the battlefield. A strong battlefield presence and confidence in your orders goes a long way in maintaining morale.                                                                  |
| [[MEDICINE]], [[CRAFTS]], and [[SURVIVAL]]                    | Basic medical knowledge, as well as being able to assist in setting up camp and jury-rig improvised devices in the heat of battle, represent strong warrior skills for fighting with the flow of battle, not against it. |

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME                 | REASON                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[MARTIAL WEAPONRY]] | The bread and butter of the battlefield, quick reflexes and confidence in your arms make you a menace to contend with.                                  |
| [[FORTRESS GUARD]]   | The ability to protect yourself, and the things you care about, can be used to halt any advance, stem any tide.                                         |
| SQUAD TACTICS        | Surrounded by loyal friends, work together to bring down even the most impossible odds.                                                                 |
| ARCANE ARSENAL       | Powerful, explosive war magics, enchanted equipment, or even just a trick or two to help you in a pinch.                                                |
| RED TOWER MEDICINE   | Both basic first aid and engineering the perfect supersoldier can deliver the means to make sure everyone comes back from the battlefield in one piece. |

As a Warrior, you probably enjoy destroying things and beating things up. But consider what it is that compels you to do so: While there are many who seek combat for the thrill of battle, the glory of victory, or to suppress and dominate those weaker than them, but for others, combat is a means to uphold their ideals. Protecting the vulnerable or defending a home, defeating an evil, and securing safety for a long time to come are reasons to join the fight, and spellcasters, tacticians, and craftspeople all have skills that assist the Warrior lifestyle in some way.
