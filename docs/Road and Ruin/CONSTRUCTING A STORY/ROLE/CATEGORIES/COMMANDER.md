Your rousing speeches in spire the masses, your orders swiftly followed by your fellow crew, and loyal pets are carefully trained to work in tandem with your efforts. You want to be a leader, a strategist, or a beast-tamer, for there is strength in numbers, and power in companionship.

Commanders, like Socialites, wield the strength of others, but also require strength of themselves. Often leading by example, Commanders are found in the thick of things, confidently giving orders for things that they themselves know how to do, and may have done for many years, and will even join in to do. As such, Commander is a role that can sit at the head of any of the other roles: the head of a team of researchers, a foreman at a build site, or the captain of a squad of soldiers. But while they may share the same responsibilities, Commanders may also feel alone, the weight of their responsibilities and stress of having to trust others to do the job right making them feel isolated.

As a Commander, handing out orders is called a [[COMMAND]]. Communicating an idea to someone or something, granting them Intention, and generating additional value if they actually follow through, it's up to you to either learn more techniques and strategies, work on teambuilding so that your people understand what you want or trust you if they don't, or are so in tune with what you want that they'll do what you want unbidden, an independent extension of your will.

Scenarios that may require a Commander:
- [[WARRIOR]], especially military, with a clear chain of command.
- [[CRAFTER]]. Working together to build a castle, or sail a ship, or manage a kitchen.
- [[DUNGEONEER]]. Being a leader of a small, diverse squad of specialists means learning to harness their myriad abilities quickly and effectively.
- [[SAGE]]. Researchers drift between having laser focus on a particular subject, and being easily distracted by a new fascination. It's up to you to keep them on task, but also to take their wanderings seriously, because it could lead to new insights and discoveries.
- [[SNEAK]]. Even if held at arms' reach, allies give you the ability to consistently be in several places at once, and hit harder, faster, and without notice. A crime ring relies on every member to work.


Some proficiencies that may help you:

| NAME                                                                 | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[COMMANDING]], [[PRESENCE]], and [[PERSUASION]] or [[INTIMIDATION]] | The bread and butter proficiency for giving orders and having your voice be heard, whether it seems like a good idea, and whether you remember asking if they thought it was.                             |
| [[BINDING]], [[HUSBANDRY]], [[RIDE]]                                 | Training a beast and harnessing it's power reliably can present several tools for multiple situations.                                                                                                    |
| [[STRATEGY]], [[CIVILIZATION]], [[ENTRAPMENT]]                       | Not only seeing an opportunity to take advantage of the current situation, but quickly drafting up a plan and having it executed, and awareness of what situations could cause your enemy to do the same. |
| [[CRAFTS]], [[RESEARCH]], [[INSIGHT]]                                | Being assigned teams who will perform specialized work on your behalf is often improved if you actually know what they're talking about.                                                                  |
| [[COGNIZANCE]], [[EMPATHY]], [[MEDIATION]]                           | You're not infallible. Being stressed out can lead to a loss of trust and morale from the team, and being able to put yourself in their shoes will make you better liked and more respected.              |

Some tag skills that you may get use out of:

| NAME               | REASON                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SQUAD TACTICS      | Chock-full of organizational structures, being able to assign allies identities to work as cogs in a much greater machine, and more powerful orders, are often pivotal to a great leader.                                  |
| SPHERE OF VENUS    | Venusians are known for operating in unison as a species; perhaps not strategically, but certainly in their mannerisms. At the height of life, the powerful stand above the rest, becoming leaders, champions, or tyrants. |
| THRYSIAN ADDENDUM  | Amplification of the best traits of you and anyone who stands with you renders you a powerful beacon for whatever cause you champion.                                                                                      |
| RED TOWER MEDICINE | Genetic alterations to make you more powerful can also amplify your traits in a way that doesn't rely on concentration or mana reserves.                                                                                   |
| THRYSIAN REVISION  | If all else fails, simply scribe a separate solution.                                                                                                                                                                      |

Some leaders are born, others made. Try to determine what drove your character to their station, what keeps them there, and what could make them leave it. They may be reluctant to visit the battlefield, instead opting to give orders from a safe distance with messengers and crystal ball, or they may be the first out of the gate, leading the charge in person. They may have been promoted to supervise other architects and builders, and relish the day that they can finally stop being the punching bag for why construction hasn't gone as smoothly or quickly as hoped. They may even pull on their strings from the shadows, their commands so subtle, so nuanced, that their 'subjects' even believe it was their own idea. Do they covet power? Is it a matter of convenience? Or are they simply the only one who's capable of seeing the bigger picture?


### COMMANDING MINIONS
Only some characters or creatures in the story will be actively controlled by players at the table. Many others will simply be elements of the environment, ambient entities who may wish you harm, or simply to be left alone. Some may be intelligent individuals, with their own opinions and objectives, others could be animals which you may bond with, and some may be summoned by you directly, created or called by magic.

#### BEHAVIOUR
Different creatures will have different behavioral traits, based not only on their species and temperament, but on their own quirks as an individual.
Tribefolk tend to have the most complex of these, but each are founded in some kind of innate reactionary behavior.

For example, a creature that is cowardly will shy from combat, opting instead to avoid confrontation, and becoming easily cowed when under direct pressure. A creature that's aggressive will lash out at anyone or anything that comes too near, and predators may even chase and attack targets on their own accord, if they're not well controlled and are hungry or bored enough.

#### GIVING [[COMMAND]]S
With a Verbal or Gestural component that the creature not only is aware of but understands, you may offer a new Intention to a creature, often with significant bonuses attached. This 'suggestion' may be something that the creature might do ordinarily on it's own, or may never do naturally unless it was actively trained for.

In either case, the creature may be resistant to the command, especially if it's something unnatural or it acts against the [[BELIEF]]S of the creature, or threatens its wellbeing in some way. PERSUASION, INTIMIDATION, or ANIMAL HANDLING proficiencies may assist in this, as would additional training and increased level of trust.

Spending additional Spirit Points, up to an amount based on the higher of your WILL, EMPATHY, or POISE, depending on the scenario and character, can grant you stronger force and increased power of authority, but can lead to social exhaustion and Hollowing over time.
