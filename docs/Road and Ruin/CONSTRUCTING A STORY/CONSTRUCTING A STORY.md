-IF YOU HAVE NO ACTIVE QUEST, GENERATE A HOOK
-A STORY CHAPTER THAT HAS NO EXPECTED CONCLUSION, BUT THAT INVOLVES THE INTRODUCTION OF A PROBLEM BY ITS END, AND A COUPLE CHARACTERS

ONCE YOU HAVE THE HOOK, PLAYERS TAKE TURNS LEADING THE NARRATIVE OF A TIME SPAN
-A DAY IS USUALLY SPLIT INTO 6 SPANS; 2 EACH OF MORNING, EVENING, AND NIGHT

DURING A SPAN, THE ACTIVE NARRATOR GENERATES A CHALLENGE, INSPIRED BY PROMPTS FROM THE DECK, AND CONSISTING OF A MAJOR SKILL CHECK
-THERE CAN BE OTHER SUB-CHALLENGES ON TEH WAY TO THE MAJOR CHALLENGE, AS YOU ATTEMPT TO BUILD ADVANTAGES, OR DECONSTRUCT DISADVANTAGES WHICH PREVENT YOU FROM SUCCEEDING
-ONCE A CHALLENGE IS ATTMEPTED, A REWARD, TWIST, OR PUNISHMENT IS GENERATED BY PROMPT, AS A RESULT OF THE PARTY'S ACTIONS AND SUCCESS
-SPANS CAN BE SKIPPED IF IT'S CLEAR THAT NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE WILL OCCUR, AND REGENERATED REWARDS ARE DOLED OUT

THERE CAN BE DIFFERENT PATTERNS TO THE STORY, BASED ON LENGTH, COMPLEXITY, OR NUMBER OF TWISTS, BUT THAT EACH NARRATOR SHOULD BE INTERESTED IN ULTIMATELY LEADING THE PARTY TO RESOVLE THE HOOK



_____
WHEN A NOUN IS GENERATED, ROLL A D20 AND CONSULT THE STORY LIST
-IF THE NUMBER ISN'T FOUND, ADD THE ITEM TO THE NEXT EMPTY SLOT
