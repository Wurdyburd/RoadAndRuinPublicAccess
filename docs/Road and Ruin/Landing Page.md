A crisp chill and smell of promised rain lingers on the stone, a tattered pennant snapping in the occasional breeze.*<br><br>*The shadows gather. Firelight marks the threshold of what some consider safety. But it is your burning expectation and anticipation of what tomorrow brings that truly warms you.* |

Welcome to the Road and Ruin wiki. This project intends to catalogue and interlink the various components of the storytelling roleplaying game of action, adventure, mystery, intrigue, exploration, or building simulator.

Take on the role of warriors and adventurers, researchers, nobles, tradesfolk and magicians as each attempts to carve out a place of their own in a world that is not so much fraught with peril, as it is mysterious, magical, and changing ever by the day.

## HOW THIS DATABASE WORKS

Road and Ruin strives to be many things, but first and foremost, a generative storytelling engine that everyone at the table can participate in, with everyone contributing something important.

The key features of Road and Ruin include:
- [[TALE]]S, as a formulaic pattern to recreate well-known tropes from popular fiction genres.
- [[ROLE]]S for themed challenges and for characters to fulfill, that act simultaneously as story direction, and encounter balance.
- A universal [[OUTCOME]] dice engine, influenced by skills, behavior, items, and environments, that puts emphasis on narrative consequence and reward.
- [[MONSTROUS]] AND [[MINIATURE]] modifiers enable a significant range of storytelling, including great beasts and diminutive adventuring.
- [[DISTANCE]] banding marries proximity and time to navigate environments, while moving between [[STAGE]]S in the [[THEATRE]] helps focus on experience rather than precise positioning, keeping storytelling at the forefront of the game.
- [[TRAIT]]S, such as belief, animal habits, and materials create an infinite array of possibilities for any story genre, including gods, pets, crafting, and more.
- [[COMBAT]] and [[DUEL]]s transform the game into a cinematic action sequence,
