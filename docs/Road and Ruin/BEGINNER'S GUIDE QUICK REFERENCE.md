| *The sun has set below the mountains of the west, a faint glow still visible behind their steeples and spires. A crisp chill and smell of promised rain lingers on the stone, a tattered pennant snapping in the occasional breeze.*<br><br>*The shadows gather. Firelight marks the threshold of what some consider safety. But it is your burning expectation and anticipation of what tomorrow brings that truly warms you.* |

________________________

Welcome to the Road and Ruin playtest! This page aims to outline the basic concepts of the game, and offer the fastest rundown on getting ready to play. There are many more rules and concepts that help to make different kinds of game stories as versatile as possible, but for the sake of testing, only the most basic rules are necessary.

The basic principles of the game are as follows:

##### **> Player responsibilities:**
- Players control one or more characters, either individually or as a team, directing them to locations, and completing tasks, using methods based on skills, beliefs, and personal goals.
- Players may opt to control a single character as a representation of themselves, but actions should always be carried out by the character from the perspective of the character, including their wants, dreams, and opinions.
- A single Host can act as primary storyteller, event and card interpreter, and challenge-level setter, or simply be a tiebreaker vote when the table moves to agree on a course of action or a ruling.
- Players take responsibility for what they call into being, but are not to create challenges that their own character have the means to solve, or story beats that their own character aspires to achieve. Instead, consider what presents the best story, and offer that spotlight to a friend.
##### **> Generating content:**
- New story moments are added to the Story Roster, while revelations roll a d20 against the story roster, recurring past characters, creatures, objects, events, and locations, or generating a new element if the die does not correspond to an existing element.
- Generating new elements, or finding "proof" of theories, draws cards from the Roundtable Deck. Each card can be interpreted by the table as a whole, or a singular Host, and can be inspirational as is, or be based on a d7 die roll, for 1) Person, 2) Creature, 3) Object, 4) Event, 5) Place, 6) A theme or trait, or 7) Draw a second card and combine the new card with the first.
##### **> Resolving events:**
- Whenever the result of an action or event can be influenced by differences in skill, or influence the direction of the characters' decisions, a d10 Outcome die is rolled, to determine the positive or negative outcome of the event, and how much it influences the story.
- The centerpoint of Good/Bad shifts, based on the result of positive and negative modifiers: upwards, for increased difficulty and necessary skill, and downward, for decreased difficulty, possessing skill, and relevant equipment. For instance, having a benefit of 3 changes the threshold of GOOD/BUT from 6, down to 3, GOOD to 4, and GOOD/AND to 7+.
- As a rule of thumb, +/-1 point of challenge should be the difference of a small child. 2, for a teenager, 3 for someone of practice, 4 for someone of skill, and 5-10 for levels of professional expertise.

| BAD/AND |  BAD  | BAD/BUT | GOOD/BUT | GOOD  | GOOD/AND |
| :-----: | :---: | :-----: | :------: | :---: | :------: |
|    1    | 2 3 4 |    5    |    6     | 7 8 9 |    10    |

##### **> Character creation and advancement:**
- A character is any kind of entity that can perform actions that can influence a story, including solving puzzles and engaging in combat, but also influencing other characters and creatures. They have beliefs, that act as both the font of aspiration and pave the path toward their goals, which are represented in the Story Roster, one item per character.
- By performing Deeds, based on personal objectives and aspirations, a character can purchase new skills from Tags, gaining Levels, and earning a new Class.
- CREATURE TYPE: What species the character is, including human and other Tribes, animal and monstrous Beasts, ethereal Spirits, Gods, and Demons, and manufactured Constructs. These define the basic range of Attributes, as well as offering some Specializations.
- RACE: A creature's upbringing and traditions. Can have biological implications, as well as offer equipment, Proficiencies, Specializations, and sometimes Skills.
- CLASS: The role a creature currently maintains, either as a Profession, Heroics, or a Shape that transforms them into something new. These grant Proficiency, Specializations, bonus stats, and sometimes equipment or Skills.
- SKILLS are organized by thematic TAG, and must be purchased in sequential rank using XP gained from Deeds. Purchasing a skill from a new rank qualifies an increase in Level, which may unlock further benefits.
- ATTRIBUTES describe a creature's basic ability evaluation, and offer advantages or penalties relative to the necessary difficulty of the task. 3 is considered the adult human average, with 2 for children, and 1 for infants (A STR4 character performing an average, STR3 activity gains +1 Outcome bonus). Five-stage sub/supercategories of Monstrous/Titanic, and Miniscule/Microscopic help define extreme creatures and transformations.
- PROFICIENCY are practiced actions or a trait of "talented" individuals. Up to two proficiencies, of 5 points each, can apply to a single Outcome roll (A +1 and +3 would tilt the Outcome by 4, or 6 down to 2).
- SPECIALIZATIONS are precise applications of technique and knowledge that have very narrow or niche uses. Actions, activities, and knowledge checks using or requiring a specialization are offset by 5 points on an Outcome roll.
- A character suffering from fear, stress, or surface-level injuries loses Steadfast Health Points, or SF, and must make checks to see if they flee or crumble when without any. Injuries striking Steadfast reduce the damage to a multiplier of the remaining steadfast. (5 striking 2 inflicts 4 damage)
- A character may spend Exertion points to add more force to a doable action, or eliminate the penalties of a Tiring or Extended action. Below a threshold, the character becomes Exhausted, causing all actions to have another Tiring penalty, which can be lessened by resting.
- A character casting spells spends Mana, which may be condensed into a Cluster for faster casting or more explosive results, and requires a Method, such as hand gestures, magic words or song, devices, or symbology, as a ritual. Mana can be gleaned from sources of energy.
- Characters asserting themselves by invoking authority, evoking an emotion or reaction, or bolstering resistance to influences such as temptation or fear, spend Spirit Points to match or anticipate energies and get a more favorable result. This includes Commands, binding Pets, contacting Spirits, or bartering with a Demon. Excessive spending causes hollowing, which demands even more SP to compensate.

**> Hastened time:**
- Entering into Hastened Time, where actions are measured across ten Time Pips in a 3-second Round, determines what order events occur.
- Characters define an Intention, a goal or belief that dictates their immediate actions and expectations. "Subdue the thieves", "Be wary of ambush", and "Escape capture" are intentions; "Fight defensively" would ready a shield to block, but "Fight aggressively" would trade that for spending Exertion on faster or stronger attacks.
- A character may spend a round to Assess, gathering their wits and observing their surroundings, to form a new Intention, which can be granted to other willing allies with a shout. A character who acts or reacts outside their Intention is rendered Distracted, negatively impacting their speed, accuracy, and skill outcome.
- A character's Intention may be a course of action that requires multiple 3-second rounds; in such a case, the character is trusted to pursue that course of action until time and Outcome determine their result.

- All characters are considered to begin acting simultaneously at the start of the round.
- If the precise timing of an action has serious consequences, such as in a duel, or dodging a trap, the characters in question produce an Outcome using an Initiative modifier: the higher of Presumptive Speed (the knowledge of possibilities, INT+ CON + proficiency in the opponent's weapon) and Reactive speed (reflex to sudden change, DEX + WIT + proficiency in your own weapon), against the Action Speed (stamina per meter travelled) of the target.
- EX: A character "fighting defensively" has the option to block an incoming sword swing with their shield. Their Presumptive Speed is (3+2) +2 Sword, while their Reactive Speed is (2+2) +2 Sword, for a benefit of 7, against the Action Speed of 3. Their Outcome roll improves by 7-3, or 4, bringing the GOOD/BUT threshold down to 2+, greatly increasing their chances of no penalty, but costing them Exertion as a result.
- EX: The same character wants to dodge an incoming arrow. Their Presumptive 5 has no Bow benefit, and Reactive 4 doesn't benefit from Swords. The arrow's Action speed is 5; point blank, this would eliminate 

- A character making an attack rolls a die based on the method of the attack, and inflicting either a Solid Blow for full damage based on the weapon's Size/Weight, a Glancing Blow for half damage rounded down, or  a Miss for no damage.
- d4 - ACCURACY, precision attack patterns, including thrusts, stabs, and projectiles. Heavily impacted by range, with high skill reward, high crit chance, but low damage besides.
- d8 - EDGED, with prolonged scrapes or slices, such as swords or claws. Moderately impacted by armor, moderate reward for skill, moderate crit chance, and moderate damage.
- d12 - CONTACT and heavy IMPACT, such as clubs and hammers. Scarcely impacted by armor, with a low reward for skill and low critical chance, but high base damage.
- Some weapons have altered values, such as a whip (d6), or a chopping axe (d10).
- A [[DODGE]] is an Initiative Outcome skill check that shifts the character to a new location, with all the costs involved.
- [[ARMOR]] reduces attack To Hit result per layer: Heavy Cloth (1AR), Chainmail (3AR), Thick Leathers (3AR), Metal Plate (4AR). May impose an Exertion tax. [[SHIELD]]S behave like weapons, rolling To Hit, but add AR, half AR, or failing to block. An attack that is not successfully evaded would inflict damage, but is reduced by armor to a value below 0, the attack is considered to have dealt No Damage rather than a Miss.
- A second Special Die is rolled alongside each To Hit die. If the total of the Special die, plus To Hit Die after dodge modifiers but before armor, is in excess of 100% of the To Hit die's maximum, the weapon's [[SPECIAL]] is activated for each 50% threshold above maximum. This can have armor penetration bonuses, critical damage multipliers, or apply special status effects like bleed or poison if armor fails to prevent the damage.

| RESULT                          | (d4)<br>Accuracy | (d6)<br>Whip | (d8)<br>Edged | (d10)<br>Chop | (d12)<br>Contact |     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --- |
| MISS - Zero damage              | 1                | 1            | 1             | 1             | 1                |     |
| GLANCING BLOW - <br>Half damage | 2                | 2-3          | 2-4           | 2-5           | 2-6              |     |
| SOLID BLOW -<br>Full damage     | 3+               | 4+           | 5+            | 6+            | 7+               |     |
| SPECIAL                         | 6, 8, 10         | 9, 12, 15    | 12, 16, 20    | 15, 20, 25    | 18, 24, 30       |     |




















# - BASIC PLAY
#### OUTCOME
Moment-to-moment gameplay of Road and Ruin involves some basic gameplay loops:
1) Identify the goal. This is described as a character or group of character's [[INTENTION]], which should at least be aware of those characters' [[BELIEF]]S. A character can change their current Intention by spending a round to [[ASSESS]], but reacting or pivoting without reassessing renders the character [[DISTRACTED]], negatively impacting their speed, accuracy, and skill outcome.
2) Gather advantages. This can be an entire loop in itself, but aims to get whatever tools and equipment, consumable resources, allies, and specialists in play on your side to assist in pursuing the goal, or eliminate as many obstacles and complications as possible.
3) Roll [[OUTCOME]], a die split 50/50 between Good and Bad possibilities, with "X, But" outcomes within one point of the split, and "X, And" outcomes five points in excess of the split. "Increased difficulty" from negative modifiers, such as situational complications and required skill, shifts the centerpoint upward, increasing the chance of Bad possibilities, while up to two relevant [[PROFICIENCY]], and other situationally positive modifiers, "decrease difficulty", shifting the centerpoint down, increasing the chance of Good possibilities. [[SPECIALIZATION]], and [[MONSTROUS]] and [[MINIATURE]] modifiers, shifts the centerpoint by 5 points instead.
    - (BAD/And: 1) (BAD: 2 3 4) (BAD, But: 5) || (GOOD, But: 6) (GOOD: 7 8 9) (GOOD/And: 10)
	- EX. While travelling on the road, or searching for treasure, a "something happens" rolls Outcome, and rolls a 5. Something bad happens, but with a silver lining: it begins to storm, but it looks like there's shelter up ahead, or you find no treasure, but uncover some clue about where some might be hidden.

#### THE STORY ROSTER
As people, creatures, objects, events, and locations are encountered during a story, they are added to the [[STORY ROSTER]], an itemized list of up to 20 items.
Whenever the story takes a new direction, roll a d20. If the result of the die corresponds to an item already on the list, that item is given recurring importance, and must be tied in to the current story beat somehow. If the die does not correspond to an existing item, a new element must be generated, and added to the lowest available space on the list.
#### DISCOVERY
When generating a new item for the Story Roster, cards are drawn from the [[ROUNDTABLE CARD]] deck, and its themes interpreted and translated into a new item of significance to the story.
A die may also be rolled to help specify the prompt, as either a Person, a Creature, an Object, an Event, a Location, or a Theme; essentially, a who, what, when, where, or why.

Discovery can also be used when [[SEARCHING]], either for something specific, like a secret door or a hidden object, or randomly browsing for anything of interest.
Investigation and Research rolls determine if any cards are drawn, and what penalties are applied, if any, over the period of time spent searching.
- Each GOOD, and GOOD AND, BAD, and BAD AND threshold identifies an additional card, while GOOD BUT identifies a card for some additional cost, such as resources or time, and BAD BUT identifies a card, and rolls twice on the next search result.
- For each GOOD card, interpret whether the card has NO significance (+0), SOME significance (+1), or HIGH significance (+2). Cards drawn from GOOD results reduce the threshold of discovery, from 21, minus every point of significance.
- For each BAD card, interpret whether the card has NO significance (+2), SOME significance, (+1), or HIGH significance (+0). Cards drawn from BAD results increase the threshold of dismissal of 1, plus every point of lacking evidence.

After cards have been drawn and Discovery and Dismissal values have been updated, roll a d20.
If the value of the die results in a value above the threshold of Discovery, something is found, with a level of importance for every five points above the Discovery threshold. Rolling a 20 adds a level of importance, and rolls the die again, for potentially additional importance levels.
If the value of the die results in a value below the threshold of Dismissal, the search here is assumed to be a waste of time by the characters, who cannot be compelled to continue searching until significant evidence can allow another roll.
(A character with an Obsession has a greatly reduced threshold for Dismissal.)

#### NAVIGATION
Areas of the world are separated into sections, based on relevance.
- A [[THEATRE]] is the maximum of what an event can affect, such as a town, dungeon, or valley.
- A single location within a Theatre is called a [[STAGE]], and while events from one stage can affect another nearby, and characters can move from stage to stage, the events on a stage are considered an independent, isolated scene.
- Scenes should be considered almost cinematic in nature, and events within a scene, on a stage, should be resolved before shifting narrative focus to a different scene, which usually involves characters on a different stage.
- Distance is measured by range bands:
	- [[TOUCHING]] describes a distance achieved by physical contact.
	- [[NEAR]] is a distance where Touching could be achieved within a short span, such as a 3-second round. Usually measured in 1-5 meters, such as a single room, and often applies to duelists.
	- [[CLOSE BY]] is still within travel distance, but for much larger spaces, such as an entire building, or a forest glade. Measured in 10m spans, this is often the limits of a scene or stage.
	- [[FAR]] is beyond most immediate physical capabilities, measured in city blocks for distance shooting and exploration. Spans of 100m, an entire chapter might take place here.
	- [[VERY FAR]] is also referred to as Horizon Distance, measured in 1-5km. This represents the extent of what a character can achieve by sight, with events measured over a day.
	- [[TOO FAR]] is a tongue-in-cheek generalization for anything a character can't do, but can describe the limit of a distance a character can travel inside of a day: 10km spans, or 40km per day on foot, with events measured per week.
	- [[WORLD]] distance measures in 100km spans, spanning quarters, thirds, and halves of the globe, and covers events that take place over an entire year.
	- [[ELSEWHERE]] is another tongue-in-cheek measurement, simply meaning that while a target is possible, it isn't presently in effective range.
- Interior spaces are defined by your relationship to them:
	- [[CORNER]]S are either inside, preventing you from becoming flanked, but reducing your movement options, or outside, which permits you to hide or peer around them without exposing yourself to threats or line of sight.
	- [[HALL]]S are long passages that connect rooms together. They may change direction, producing Corners, and have Doors that lead to Rooms. Their length is measured in the travel time of Distance bands, such as Short (1-5 rounds), or Long (5-10 rounds). They may have Obstacles, if used for storage, have decorations, or due to destruction.
	- [[DOOR]]S are openings in walls that lead to Rooms. They may be intentional, or the result of destruction, but are large enough for a creature to pass through. They may have obstructions, and be either Open, or Closed, preventing travel and line of sight.
	- [[ROOM]]S are spaces that are defined by enclosed borders. Typically interior, with Inside Corners, an outdoor space such as a garden could be considered a room. Rooms often have a singular purpose, such as for sleeping, for eating, cooking, disposal, storage, or labor of some specific variety or another.
	- [[OBSTACLE]]S are objects in the environment that prevent or otherwise inhibit travel through the space. They can be decorative, such as a statue, or utility-oriented, such as a crate, or caused by destruction, such as stalagmites and large rocks.
	- Positioning a character [[BEHIND]] an Outside Corner, a Closed Door, or Obstacle breaks [[LINE OF SIGHT]], and allows the creature to [[HIDE]] or benefit from [[COVER]].
	- A creature may move [[ABOVE]] another creature, object, or surface, by [[CLIMB]]ING, [[FLIGHT]], or [[JUMP]]ING. This increases the character's visibility, for better (Presence/Performance) or worse (hiding), but a creature that is (height x distance from the edge) above a creature (distance from the base) below, gains a hide bonus as though Behind or Below.
	- A creature may move [[BELOW]] another creature, object, or surface, by [[BURROW]]ING underground, [[SWIM]]MING underwater, or moving beneath another creature that is larger than they are. This grants a comparative hiding bonus, as though Behind.

#### TIME
Different activities tend to require different amounts of time. In Road and Ruin, many activities can be described as the amount of time, required to travel a distance, and complete an objective.
- A [[ROUND]] is measured in 10 Time Pips, which take place over 3-second spans of time. These are usually isolated to a single [[STAGE]], and combine over several rounds to make a [[SCENE]]. A character may need several rounds to travel Close By, or [[EXERT]] themselves to travel the same distance in a shorter amount of time. A creature must spend at least one round to RE[[ASSESS]] the situation, to alter their [[INTENTION]] to pursue a new purpose, which may involve skipping ahead to that moment in time, or shifting to other Scenes or Stages in the meantime.
- A [[DAY]] is measured in six [[DAY SPAN]]S: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening, and two spans of night. Many abilities, effects, or actions may only last a single Day Span, or require upkeep or additional resources to prolong the effect.
- If necessary, each Day Span can be marked through the burning of four torches, if indoors, underground, or at night.
- A [[SPELL]] takes an exponential amount of time to cast, per point of mana in use, but some spellcasters have mastered quickly casting certain spells by rote over a single round, or even instantaneously.
- [[INITIATIVE]] is generated when the precise timing between two events have serious consequences, such as in a duel, or dodging a trap. This is applied as a modifier based on the creature's [[PRESUMPTIVE SPEED]], or knowledge of possibility (INT + CON + proficiency in the opponent's weapon), and [[REACTIVE SPEED]], or reflexes based on sudden change (DEX + WIT + proficiency in your own weapon). Failure to react quickly enough can influence the delay before a creature acts, blocks, counterattacks, or dodges, creating a positive or negative modifier for the Outcome roll.

#### COMBAT
Forming an Intention to injure, maim, kill, or otherwise incapacitate another creature, or responding to another creature who intends such toward the character, enters into Round-by-Round play of combat.
Different attack patterns use their own Outcome die, inflicting either a Solid Blow for full damage, a Glancing Blow for half damage, rounded down, No Damage, a Miss, or enabling Special effects, such as a critical hit. The die is positively influenced by proficiency in that weapon, and negatively influenced by distance, target armor or shields, enemy evasion, or other conditions, such as being blinded. A weapon has a Solid Blow damage profile based on it's [[SIZE]], modified by [[WEIGHT]].
- d4 - Accuracy-based, precision attack patterns, including thrusts, stabs, and projectiles. Heavily impacted by range, with high skill reward, high crit chance, but low damage besides.
- d8 - Edged weapons, with prolonged scrapes or slices, such as swords or claws. Moderately impacted by armor, moderate reward for skill, moderate crit chance, and moderate damage.
- d12 - Contact-based and heavy blows, such as clubs and hammers. Scarcely impacted by armor, with a low reward for skill and low critical chance, but high base damage.
- Some weapons have altered values, such as a whip (d6), or a chopping axe (d10).
- A [[DODGE]] is an Outcome skill check, increasing in difficulty with the weapon's attack speed.
- [[ARMOR]] reduces attack To Hit result per layer: Heavy Cloth (1AR), Chainmail (3AR), Thick Leathers (3AR), Metal Plate (4AR). May impose an Exertion tax. [[SHIELD]]S behave like weapons, rolling To Hit, but add AR, half AR, or failing to block. An attack that is not successfully evaded would inflict damage, but is reduced by armor to a value below 0, the attack is considered to have dealt No Damage rather than a Miss.
- A second Special Die is rolled alongside each To Hit die. If the total of the Special die, plus To Hit Die after dodge modifiers but before armor, is in excess of 100% of the To Hit die's maximum, the weapon's [[SPECIAL]] is activated for each 50% threshold above maximum. This can have armor penetration bonuses, critical damage multipliers, or apply special status effects like bleed or poison if armor fails to prevent the damage.

| RESULT                          | (d4)<br>Accuracy | (d6)<br>Whip | (d8)<br>Edged | (d10)<br>Chop | (d12)<br>Contact |     |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --- |
| MISS - Zero damage              | 1                | 1            | 1             | 1             | 1                |     |
| GLANCING BLOW - <br>Half damage | 2                | 2-3          | 2-4           | 2-5           | 2-6              |     |
| SOLID BLOW -<br>Full damage     | 3+               | 4+           | 5+            | 6+            | 7+               |     |
| SPECIAL                         | 6, 8, 10         | 9, 12, 15    | 12, 16, 20    | 15, 20, 25    | 18, 24, 30       |     |
#### HEALTH
Creatures have [[HEALTH]] points, which represent the extent of physical damage they've suffered that will take a long time to recover, and [[STEADFAST]], a morale shield that reduces incoming impacts, and can be worked off in short time.

Incoming damage strikes Steadfast health points first, inflicting a multiple of the remaining points. For instance, if a creature with 3SF remaining was struck by 2 damage, it would lose 2SF, but if struck with 4 or 5 damage, it would only lose 3SF. If struck with 6, 7, or 8 damage, it would lose the 3SF, and take 3 points of damage to its Health.

If a creature has no remaining Steadfast, they are considered [[SHAKEN]], and it's Intention is replaced with doing whatever necessary so as to no longer feel vulnerable, exposed, and mortal. 

If a creature spends an entire round under the eye and blade of a creature that could have struck it that round, it suffers 1SF loss as [[BATTLE STRESS]]. [[FEAR]] can also inflict SF damage this way, failing a saving roll.

Health point damage may leave lasting scars, and can take days, or even weeks to fully recover without medical attention, if it ever does.

#### EXERTION
A creature that physically pushes itself spends points from an [[EXERTION]] pool, as 10x the creature's Endurance attribute.
- Spending 1 Exertion allows for the reroll of a physical skill check, taking the higher value.
- A [[TIRING]] activity rolls an additional skill check die, taking the lower value. A physical activity that lasts longer than a single round is considered Tiring each round beyond the first, and moving large or heavy weights is Tiring from the start.
- Having less than half the Exertion pool remaining inflicts [[EXHAUSTION]], inflicting +5 Increased Difficulty, and rolling an additional skill check die, and taking the lower value. This can stack with Tiring activity.
- A creature may spend 1 Exertion to negate the effects of one of either Tiring or Exhaustion for a single skill check.

A creature may spend a round to take a [[BREATHER]], and recover exertion points equal to 1d10, plus the results of a proficiency roll. This may elevate the creature back above the Exhaustion threshold.
When at rest for several minutes, a creature can roll one of their remaining Endurance points as a d10, adding the result back to their Exertion pool, up to the maximum.
Each 4hr span at rest recovers 1 Endurance point, which is spent immediately if Exertion is not full.

#### SPELLS
All living creatures produce a latent magical force known as mana, and have a capacity equal to the sum of their mental attributes. Knowing how to apply this energy to warp the nature of reality is called a [[SPELL]].
[[MANA]] can be spent as is, performing spells over minutes, hours, or even days, or condensed using a ritual while resting, into a 2-5 point [[CLUSTER]]. Clusters allow for the casting of a spell immediately, but are consumed in their entirety in the casting. Some spells are unstable to the point that they require the full force of a mana cluster, or else the spell will fail to materialize. Mana can also also be harvested via [[GLEANING]], and be tinged with the Essence of the element or creature it came from.




________________________
# - STORY GENERATION
The goal of Road and Ruin is to generate a story, navigating twists and turns, in order to experience the thrill of the unexpected, and the satisfaction of a puzzle solved to the best of your ability.

While a single player may act as host and perform duties as referee and primary narrator, all players at the table hold some degree of storytelling responsibility. In such cases, the host becomes a tiebreaker, but decisions and developments should be discussed and voted on as a table. Responsibilities for narrating and generating content should revolve from player to player, so that no one player suffers from stress or creative burnout.

- A [[TALE]] is a basic framework for a narrative. Loosely based around popular storytelling tropes and genres of fiction, they present mechanics and a pattern to follow, as well as some unique Roles.
- A [[ROLE]] is an overall archetypal value to a story, as well as an assessment of the mechanic skills a character might possess to solve a problem. These can be used to judge the difficulty of an encounter, based on the problems that a Role might be required to solve.
- The [[STORY ROSTER]] is a catalogue of nouns, that when people, creatures, objects, events, and locations may come into play, they are either recalled from previous discoveries, or a new one is generated, based on correlation on a d20.
- [[DISCOVERY]] is a process of [[SEARCHING]] by drawing [[ROUNDTABLE CARD]]S, and interpreting the results as a who, what, when, where, why, or how, or a combination of other cards. Dismissal occurs when a character lacks sufficient evidence to believe there is any point in continuing to search.

________________________
# - CHARACTERS
Characters can exist with multiple levels of depth and complexity. A random farmer found on the side of the road might be asked for directions, and never seen again, but a hero who is dragged through fire and bloodshed for years will probably have developed a few skills, and opinions.

Organically, a character is defined by their [[CREATURE TYPE]], which defines the primary range of [[ATTRIBUTE]]S a creature can expect. Different creatures may end up having differing expectations of size, power, or skill, and so can be noted as having a power level. For balance reasons, creatures of greater base power may be given a penalty to curb their growth, or vulnerabilities, or less powerful creatures can be offered advantages to grow in power and skill faster, but narrative games may not necessarily offer these options.

A [[TRIBE]] type creature may be further specified by a [[RACE]], which may alter the Tribe's statistical expectations, [[TRADITION]]S, and [[BELIEF]]S, and may be Tribe-specific. [[BEAST]]S fall into either [[ANIMAL]] or [[MONSTER]] category, and may have a subtype or subspecies, which can impact appearance, behavior, or abilities. [[SPIRIT]]S are more metaphysical, defined by an [[ASPECT]] and symbolized by [[ICON]]S, that follow [[LAW]]S and enact [[TENET]]S, and can fall under [[ELEMENTAL]], [[FAE]], [[GHOST]], [[DEMON]], or even [[GOD]] categories, and [[CONSTRUCT]]S, while not being necessarily alive, still possess a kind of autonomy that allows them to impact a story.

[[ATTRIBUTE]]S are nine categories, split by physical/mental/social, and power/precision/persistence. A normal creature can expect a range of 1-5 of any, though adult humans average 2-3 in each of [[STRENGTH]], [[DEXTERITY]], and [[ENDURANCE]], [[INTELLIGENCE]], [[WITS]], and [[FOCUS]], [[WILL]], [[CONNECTION]], and [[POISE]].
Attributes impact Outcome dice rolls by granting a bonus, or penalty, based on what is expected for a task. For example, if a task that can be improved with strength only requires a infantile level of strength to succeed, having STR 2 would grant a +1, and STR 3 a +2 to the Outcome roll.
Attributes can be defined as [[MONSTROUS]] and [[MINIATURE]], for a +5 or -5 super- and sub-category each. Monstrous Strength 3, for instance, is equivalent to STR 8, while a task requiring infantile strength, for Miniature Strength 5, would still suffer a -1 penalty.
[[SECONDARY]] attributes, such as [[STEADFAST]] health, [[EXERTION]] capacity, [[MANA CAPACITY]], and [[SPIRIT POINTS]] are derived from creature type, and primary attributes.

[[PROFICIENCY]] can be earned from skills, but also from classes, and even as a racial or creature bonus. Loosely grouped by physical, mental, and social, proficiency can benefit any reasonable application; Herbalism might be used in a Dexterity check to carefully shape a hedge, but could be used with Intelligence to recall what plants make for good tea. [[SPECIALIZATION]] represents a niche use of a proficiency, such as intense surgery or performing a distraction, and grants +5 to the outcome instead, which becomes a [[DISCIPLINE]] if specialization is mandatory, such as in smithing.

[[XP]] is earned by performing [[DEED]]S, which are individual to a character's dreams and the duties of their role and class, and spent to purchase skills from [[TAG]]S, which are groupings of abilities by theme.
Purchasing a skill from a Tag rank a character does not already possess a skill in increases the character's [[LEVEL]], granting a [[BUILD POINT]] to spend on Class features. Build Points can also be distributed in order to help equalize different characters of different species.
After each 5 levels, a character gains another [[CLASS]] selection, which may be one it already possesses. A Class is more like the lens through which skills gain meaning, gaining new Deeds, features to spend Build Points on, and granting new unique abilities or equipment, or modifying others.

Characters begin with a minimum level of 0, and a starting Class called a [[BACKGROUND]], which describes their upbringing and culture, and what activities they may have practiced.
Classes fall into three categories: [[PROFESSION]]S, which are trades and services in exchange for income, [[HEROIC]]S, which are often highly specialized and tend to inspire, and [[SHAPES]], physical transformations or alterations. Only a single Shift is allowed per character.

[[EQUIPMENT]] can be earned or purchased for gold, or any other kind of currency. Equipment either grants specialization (and some actions may require specialized gear, as like a Discipline), or are protective, allowing a reroll of a die if a Bad result occurs. Equipment can be damaged, which causes it to perform like [[IMPROVISED]] equipment, increasing the Bad-And result threshold by 1 per status.

Social creatures tend to use their experiences and cultural upbringing as a foundation for their [[BELIEF]]S. There may be [[LAW]]S that they follow, and [[TENET]]S that they pursue. They may humor [[COMPULSION]]S, which are based on instinct or [[INTERPRETATION]]S they have about the world, which may in turn stem from [[TRADITION]]S.
Social creatures also tend to develop a [[REPUTATION]]. This can result in positive advantages with a given organization or individual, or negative responses, and either of these may be based on the proven history of the character's actions, rumors spread about them, or even plain old stereotyping.
