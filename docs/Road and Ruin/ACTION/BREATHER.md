Taking a moment to catch your breath after a strenuous activity allows you to recoup some of the energy you spent while doing so.

Make an OUTCOME roll, using proficiencies relevant to the activity you were doing. HAULING, for example, would be used for shifting heavy weights, ATHLETICS for acrobatics or swimming or climbing, and WEAPON PROFICIENCY for combat using that weapon.


| RESULT   | OUTCOME                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| FAIL AND | Recover 15% exertion, rounded down. |
| FAIL     | Recover 30% exertion, rounded down. |
| FAIL BUT | Recover 45% exertion, rounded down. |
| WIN BUT  | Recover 60% exertion, rounded down. |
| WIN      | Recover 75% exertion, rounded down. |
| WIN AND  | Recover 90% exertion, rounded down. |
No amount of training or outcome can ever recover 100% of an exertive activity.
