While resting, and as the result of certain magics, a character can regain lost resources.

## PASSIVE GENERATION
Characters naturally recover resources over time, measured in [[SPAN]]S.
## [[REST]]
By By setting aside time to recover strength characters can recover lost resources at a faster rate.
- [[BREATHER]]: Taking a brief moment to catch your breath after a strenuous activity recoups a portion of the energy you spent while doing so.
- [[SHORT REST]]: When being [[AT REST]], recover points at a faster rate. Requires at least 1 Span.
- [[LONG REST]]: Being [[AT REST]], for several Spans, and even several days, a character may perform the occasional odd job or casual activity without having to keep track of each activity. Training, for example, may ordinarily be exhausting, but for narrative purposes, it's assumed the character practices within save levels.
