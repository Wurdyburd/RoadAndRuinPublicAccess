*Road and Ruin* is a game played by one or several players, in the hopes of producing a story.

Stories are myriad, picky things; some are charming, and others spiteful. Some pierce with razor-sharp wit, while others are familiar, a comfortable groove like a stone worn smooth by fondness.

It is the goal of *Road and Ruin* to bring these preferences, these well-worn experiences, and the nostalgia that carries stories far into the future to the same table, such that magic might happen, or lightning strike twice.



## WHAT DO I DO? TYPES OF PLAYERS

In Road and Ruin, players take on the identity of either a Player, or the active Host:

| Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| PLAYER | -Provide direction for one or more characters, that may be shared with other players.<br>-Contribute their ideas and personal experiences and knowledge of pop culture to an emergent and unique storyline.<br>-Roll dice to determine whether the outcome of characters' actions are successful or not.<br>-Vote when another player's ideas or behavior are controversial or lead to disagreements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| HOST   | -May be a player, the same as the above, with or without a character of their own, and rotate Host authority between players on a chapter-by-chapter basis.<br>-Wields tiebreaker authority in the case of a tie vote.<br>-Interprets cards drawn from the Roundtable deck, or defers that authority to the table.<br>-May determine the actions and dice rolls for characters not actively in the adventuring group, or defers that authority to the table.<br>-Often, for a well-planned story to take place, a single Host might oversee the story in its entirety, for proper pacing and the delivery of secrets. In such cases, other responsibilities may be shared to other players at the table. |

| NOTE: Rotating or primary Host responsibility varies in complexity. Many game systems expect for a single Host to be in control, and find the responsibilities of a rotating Host to be off-putting and challenging. Inversely, a single Host can mean significantly more work and responsibility for that player, both inside and outside the game.<br><br>Try to discuss the expectations of the group, and don’t forget that you can change the complexity of any Host or mechanics system in the game at any time to suit the needs, energy, and expectations of the group. |

### ROUND TABLE RULING

No one player is any more or less important than any other. Even in the case of host tie-breaking, the cardinal rule of the game is that the players are in agreement about what’s happening. If there are no players, there is no game, and so everyone’s concerns and contributions should be counted and taken seriously.

Players that find themselves on the losing side of many votes should consider if they are trying too hard to shape the game that others want to play. Likewise, you can work with other players to find a compromise that everyone can enjoy.

## CONSTRUCTING A STORY

When *Road and Ruin* aims to produce a story, a story is defined as a series of events that:
- Involve recurring characters or themes
- Begins with a hook
- Escalates through arcs of escalating tension or intrigue
- Introduces and overcomes challenges
- Employs twists to produce the unexpected
- Offers a platform for character development and relationships to form
- Culminates in a conclusion that will be memorable, if not a happy ending
- Lays the groundwork for future stories and adventures

So long as everyone at the table is enjoying themselves, a sense of thrill is achieved, and/or a memorable story is produced, the experience is considered a success.

A story, mechanically, is often comprised of two major variables: a Tale, and Roles.

Tales are storytelling structures produce a predictable framework of connect-the-dots events for storytellers who may be unfamiliar with the patterns and tropes of a specific genre, whereas Roles represent a categorical umbrella of sorts, a collection of actions and skills that help to move the story forward.

In terms of WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, and HOW,
- Tales represent the WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, and WHY
- Roles represent the WHO, and HOW

### >TYPES OF TALES

While there as many different stories as there are stars in the night sky, Road and Ruin aims to condense certain patterns and tropes down to both a predictable framework, and reliable twists.

Different kinds of Tales cover different story genres, from Action, Mystery, Intrigue, and Horror, and can be used in multiple different settings, whether your adventure is in mud-soaked medieval Fantasy, space-faring Sci-Fi, or beleaguered Modern Day.
