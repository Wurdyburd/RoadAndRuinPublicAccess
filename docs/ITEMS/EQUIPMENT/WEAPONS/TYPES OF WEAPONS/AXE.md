'Axes' refer to an item style, where a heavier blade is affixed to the end of a handle at a right angle.

The blade:
- Usually made of metal, but can be made of stone or bone
- Is a crescent shape in front of a heavy weight, for chopping and distributing an impact lengthwise
- Can be one-sided, or double-sided
- Often range from a 3-5lbs

The handle:
- Usually made of wood, but can be any suitably long and sturdy rod
- Often range from 30-36", or slightly less than half the body height.

Axes double as a tool, used for chopping and severing.
They often require two hands for a well-powered swing, but smaller, lighter, one-handed axes called hatchets can be used for lighter work.
As a weapon, they can be used as [[PUBLICFACING/Road and Ruin - Copy/ITEMS/EQUIPMENT/WEAPONS/TYPES OF WEAPONS/SIMPLE WEAPONS]].
More advanced techniques or familiarity with axes require [[Road and Ruin/CHARACTERS/PROFICIENCY/PROFICIENCY TYPES/Gear Proficiency/Offense/AXE USE]] proficiency.
An example of an [[Road and Ruin/CHARACTERS/STATUS/IMPROVISED]] axe might be a shovel.
