'Swords' refer to an item style, where a longer length of blade is affixed to a handle.

The blade:
- Usually made of metal, but can be made of sharpened wood
- Often double-sided, though single-edged swords exist
- Can slice, chop, and pierce
- Often have extra length called a tang that extends into the handle for greater durability and stability

The handle:
- Usually made of wood, but can be bone, or metal
- Can be long enough for a single-hand grip, or a hand and a half
- Has a pommel end, used to keep the handle attached to the tang of the blade
- May have a wrapping of leather or cloth for better grip

Swords are an extremely versatile weapon, with many cultural techniques that may require [[Road and Ruin/CHARACTERS/PROFICIENCY/PROFICIENCY TYPES/Gear Proficiency/Offense/SWORD USE]] proficiency, but can easily be swung as [[PUBLICFACING/Road and Ruin - Copy/ITEMS/EQUIPMENT/WEAPONS/TYPES OF WEAPONS/SIMPLE WEAPONS]].

Because of the cultural significance and history of swords, they may be worn as badges of honor, or be otherwise quite decorative and unsuitable for real combat.

They also exist in a wide array of sizes, shapes, weights, and materials, choosing to prioritize one of slashing, chopping, or piercing attack types.

They can be wielded in one hand, and will often be accompanied by [[SHIELDS]], or a second small weapon. They can also sometimes be wielded with both hands, increasing their thrusting and chopping power, and speed and accuracy, with a slight loss of range.
