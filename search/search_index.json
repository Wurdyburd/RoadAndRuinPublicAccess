Usually measured in 1-5 meters, such as a single room, and often applies to duelists.     - [[CLOSE BY]] is still within travel distance, but for much larger spaces, such as an entire building, or a forest glade. Measured in 10m spans, this is often the limits of a scene or stage.     - [[FAR]] is beyond most immediate physical capabilities, measured in city blocks for distance shooting and exploration. Spans of 100m, an entire chapter might take place here.     - [[VERY FAR]] is also referred to as Horizon Distance, measured in 1-5km. This represents the extent of what a character can achieve by sight, with events measured over a day.     - [[TOO FAR]] is a tongue-in-cheek generalization for anything a character can't do, but can describe the limit of a distance a character can travel inside of a day: 10km spans, or 40km per day on foot, with events measured per week.     - [[WORLD]] distance measures in 100km spans, spanning quarters, thirds, and halves of the globe, and covers events that take place over an entire year.     - [[ELSEWHERE]] is another tongue-in-cheek measurement, simply meaning that while a target is possible, it isn't presently in effective range. - Interior spaces are defined by your relationship to them:     - [[CORNER]]S are either inside, preventing you from becoming flanked, but reducing your movement options, or outside, which permits you to hide or peer around them without exposing yourself to threats or line of sight.     - [[HALL]]S are long passages that connect rooms together. They may change direction, producing Corners, and have Doors that lead to Rooms. Their length is measured in the travel time of Distance bands, such as Short (1-5 rounds), or Long (5-10 rounds). They may have Obstacles, if used for storage, have decorations, or due to destruction.     - [[DOOR]]S are openings in walls that lead to Rooms. They may be intentional, or the result of destruction, but are large enough for a creature to pass through. They may have obstructions, and be either Open, or Closed, preventing travel and line of sight.     - [[ROOM]]S are spaces that are defined by enclosed borders. Typically interior, with Inside Corners, an outdoor space such as a garden could be considered a room. Rooms often have a singular purpose, such as for sleeping, for eating, cooking, disposal, storage, or labor of some specific variety or another.     - [[OBSTACLE]]S are objects in the environment that prevent or otherwise inhibit travel through the space. They can be decorative, such as a statue, or utility-oriented, such as a crate, or caused by destruction, such as stalagmites and large rocks.     - Positioning a character [[BEHIND]] an Outside Corner, a Closed Door, or Obstacle breaks [[LINE OF SIGHT]], and allows the creature to [[HIDE]] or benefit from [[COVER]].     - A creature may move [[ABOVE]] another creature, object, or surface, by [[CLIMB]]ING, FLIGHT, or [[JUMP]]ING. This increases the character's visibility, for better (Presence/Performance) or worse (hiding), but a creature that is (height x distance from the edge) above a creature (distance from the base) below, gains a hide bonus as though Behind or Below.     - A creature may move [[BELOW]] another creature, object, or surface, by [[BURROW]]ING underground, [[SWIM]]MING underwater, or moving beneath another creature that is larger than they are.

In Road and Ruin, many activities can be described as the amount of time, required to travel a distance, and complete an objective. - A [[ROUND]] is measured in 10 Time Pips, which take place over 3-second spans of time. These are usually isolated to a single [[STAGE]], and combine over several rounds to make a [[SCENE]]. A character may need several rounds to travel Close By, or [[EXERT]] themselves to travel the same distance in a shorter amount of time. A creature must spend at least one round to REASSESS the situation, to alter their INTENTION to pursue a new purpose, which may involve skipping ahead to that moment in time, or shifting to other Scenes or Stages in the meantime. - A [[DAY]] is measured in six [[DAY SPAN]]S: morning, noon, afternoon, and evening, and two spans of night. Many abilities, effects, or actions may only last a single Day Span, or require upkeep or additional resources to prolong the effect. - If necessary, each Day Span can be marked through the burning of four torches, if indoors, underground, or at night. - A SPELL takes an exponential amount of time to cast, per point of mana in use, but some spellcasters have mastered quickly casting certain spells by rote over a single round, or even instantaneously. - [[INITIATIVE]] is generated when the precise timing between two events have serious consequences, such as in a duel, or dodging a trap. This is applied as a modifier based on the creature's [[PRESUMPTIVE SPEED]], or knowledge of possibility (INT + CON + proficiency in the opponent's weapon), and [[REACTIVE SPEED]], or reflexes based on sudden change (DEX + WIT + proficiency in your own weapon).

SPIRITS are more metaphysical, defined by an ASPECT and symbolized by ICONS, that follow LAWS and enact TENETS, and can fall under [[ELEMENTAL]], [[FAE]], [[GHOST]], [[DEMON]], or even [[GOD]] categories, and CONSTRUCTS, while not being necessarily alive, still possess a kind of autonomy that allows them to impact a story.</p> <p>ATTRIBUTES are nine categories, split by physical/mental/social, and power/precision/persistence. A normal creature can expect a range of 1-5 of any, though adult humans average 2-3 in each of STRENGTH, DEXTERITY, and ENDURANCE, INTELLIGENCE, WITS, and FOCUS, WILL, CONNECTION, and POISE. Attributes impact Outcome dice rolls by granting a bonus, or penalty, based on what is expected for a task. For example, if a task that can be improved with strength only requires a infantile level of strength to succeed, having STR 2 would grant a +1, and STR 3 a +2 to the Outcome roll. Attributes can be defined as [[MONSTROUS]] and [[MINIATURE]], for a +5 or -5 super- and sub-category each. Monstrous Strength 3, for instance, is equivalent to STR 8, while a task requiring infantile strength, for Miniature Strength 5, would still suffer a -1 penalty. SECONDARY attributes, such as [[STEADFAST]] health, EXERTION capacity, MANA CAPACITY, and SPIRIT POINTS are derived from creature type, and primary attributes.</p> <p>PROFICIENCY can be earned from skills, but also from classes, and even as a racial or creature bonus. Loosely grouped by physical, mental, and social, proficiency can benefit any reasonable application; Herbalism might be used in a Dexterity check to carefully shape a hedge, but could be used with Intelligence to recall what plants make for good tea. SPECIALIZATION represents a niche use of a proficiency, such as intense surgery or performing a distraction, and grants +5 to the outcome instead, which becomes a DISCIPLINE if specialization is mandatory, such as in smithing.</p> <p>[[XP]] is earned by performing [[DEED]]S, which are individual to a character's dreams and the duties of their role and class, and spent to purchase skills from TAGS, which are groupings of abilities by theme. Purchasing a skill from a Tag rank a character does not already possess a skill in increases the character's [[LEVEL]], granting a [[BUILD POINT]] to spend on Class features. Build Points can also be distributed in order to help equalize different characters of different species. After each 5 levels, a character gains another [[CLASS]] selection, which may be one it already possesses. A Class is more like the lens through which skills gain meaning, gaining new Deeds, features to spend Build Points on, and granting new unique abilities or equipment, or modifying others.</p> <p>Characters begin with a minimum level of 0, and a starting Class called a [[BACKGROUND]], which describes their upbringing and culture, and what activities they may have practiced. Classes fall into three categories: [[PROFESSION]]S, which are trades and services in exchange for income, [[HEROIC]]S, which are often highly specialized and tend to inspire, and [[SHAPES]], physical transformations or alterations. Only a single Shift is allowed per character.</p> <p>EQUIPMENT can be earned or purchased for gold, or any other kind of currency. Equipment either grants specialization (and some actions may require specialized gear, as like a Discipline), or are protective, allowing a reroll of a die if a Bad result occurs. Equipment can be damaged, which causes it to perform like IMPROVISED equipment, increasing the Bad-And result threshold by 1 per status.</p> <p>Social creatures tend to use their experiences and cultural upbringing as a foundation for their BELIEFS. There may be LAWS that they follow, and TENETS that they pursue. They may humor COMPULSIONS, which are based on instinct or INTERPRETATIONS they have about the world, which may in turn stem from TRADITIONS. Social creatures also tend to develop a [[REPUTATION]]. This can result in positive advantages with a given organization or individual, or negative responses, and either of these may be based on the proven history of the character's actions, rumors spread about them, or even plain old stereotyping.</p> POWER PRECISION PERSISTENCE SECONDARY PHYSICAL STRENGTH DEXTERITY ENDURANCE EXERTION (STA) MENTAL INTELLIGENCE WITS FOCUS MANA (MP) SOCIAL WILL CONNECTION POISE SPIRIT POINTS (SP) SECONDARY [[STEADFAST]] <p>You can refer to [[EXAMPLES]] to get an idea of what different types of characters can appear like.</p>"},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/KEYWORDS/","title":"KEYWORDS","text":"<p>Basic Concepts:</p> <p>Character Creation: A combination of variables, including species and subtypes, variation from the standard attributes, and proficiencies, specializations, and skills. </p> <p>Build Concepts: These mechanics are the primary components that connect themes.</p> DESCRIPTION Favored Weapons.

FAIL/BUT fails, but gains some advantage for a future roll, WIN/BUT barely succeeds, but with some complication or cost. - Up to 5 points for each of up to 2 different proficiencies can act as positive bonuses, bringing the difficulty down.

If an adult human expects to have Strength 3, and a task should be a little hard, each point below Strength 4 inflicts a 1-difficulty penalty. - EXAMPLE: Making a precise surgical cut while operating on a creature might need at least Medicine 3, so the difficulty threshold slides up the scale three points, making the minimum number for success a 9 instead of a 6.

Favor is a power bestowed by one entity, to another, and it doesn't even have to be alive. Warriors can favor a specific sword over any other sword, clerics and warlocks vie for the favor of their patrons, and spirits bestow blessings and abilities over those they favor. Abilities might cost points of favor, which then have to be replenished by earning the being's trust, or may passively scale with the maximum amount of favor, or the amount you currently have. You may have the favor of a single animal spirit, or animals in general, or a single god, or an entire pantheon.</li> <li>[[REPUTATION]]. This also has multiple sub-types, based on what you represent to different factions. A high reputation with Elves might help grant you audience with their king, and \"Friend to Elves\" might buy you some respect with the human village on the outskirts of the forest, but it might also earn you their ire, while \"Slayer of Elves\" might grant you a bonus to intimidation checks. Like favor, you can trade in reputation, staking your reputation on a promise, that if delivered, will increase your reputation, but if failed, will cost a greater amount.</li> <li>MANA. The catch-all magical resource, most living creatures have a mana capacity based on their mental aptitude. Mana is energy that is used to facilitate alterations and transmutations of natural laws, greasing the wheels of an otherwise very scientific methodology. Mana can be condensed, forming packets that enable the delivery of more energy within a single moment than 'liquid' mana, and some spells include processes that require these, as they're too unstable to be cast slowly over time. Mana also has essence, a kind of flavoring that denotes where it came from; it can be elementally attuned, or to a living creature from where it came, and this allows for sympathetic magical practices, such as locating a son by reading the magical essence of the father, or having stronger pyromancy by using mana reaped from a blaze.</li> <li>SPIRIT POINTS. Another kind of internal energy, but one associated with the soul, and so noticeably absent from undead and machines, but abundant in spirits, which can be used to animate such creatures. SP can be spent to amplify the exertion of will on other creatures, or to bolster yourself against outside influences. However, SP can be spent in excess, causing a kind of \"spiritual hollowing\" that causes the creature to less assertive and more vulnerable to outside influence, but that can be recovered over time, but below a certain threshold, \"soulless\" confers maximum penalties, without the chance to recover naturally.</li> <li>[[COIN]]. A basic resource in any society, the value of this currency is based largely on the willingness of others to recognize it. Because of this, articles such as gems may be traded in place of coin, and different nations may mint different currency to use within their borders. Coin as a mechanic can be overly simplified for the sake of a smoother game, using just one currency the world over, or expanded out for use in games that involve trade, international relations, or currencies that mean more to secret societies.</li> <li>[[FOOD]]/[[WATER]]/MEDICINE. Basic resources, but still important nonetheless. This is usually waived in many games, but if the game takes place over long journeys, or involve securing resources for a community, there are many gameplay systems that revolve around them.</li> <li>[[MATERIALS]]. Effectively, any item that is processed, is consumed, or is used in some way to increase the value of another material. This might mean components for a ritual, ingredients for a meal, metals for smithing, or chemicals for mixing. This section requires an entire post of it's own, but Material Cost can also be waived by any playtable that doesn't feel like micromanaging such things. It does represent a non-gold, non-reputation reward for exploration though.</li> <li>[[BATTERY]]. Also called Energy, this is a storage house that grants power to electrical devices. This is more for Road and Ruin's sci-fi elements, but it's important to note that Batteries, Mana, and Spirit Points aren't ordinarily convertible between each other. A Generator might create an amount of Energy over a period of time, while different devices use different amounts of energy for different predetermined uses.</li> <li>EXERTION. Also called Stamina, this represents the physical limits a body can be pushed within spans of time. Drawing from an Exertion Pool grants the stamina needed to sprint distances farther and faster, move heavy weights, and perform combat maneuvers, but dipping below Exertion thresholds imparts Exhaustion, a penalty to reaction speed and Exertion regeneration. Performing activities a character is proficient in refunds more Exertion points once they finish the task, but never 100%, so all characters must take a seat and rest eventually.</li> </ul>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Resource"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/ACTION/BREATHER/","title":"BREATHER","text":"<p>Taking a moment to catch your breath after a strenuous activity allows you to recoup some of the energy you spent while doing so.</p> <p>Make an OUTCOME roll, using proficiencies relevant to the activity you were doing.

They host a palette of muddy hues, ranging from murky browns to vibrant greens and yellows, with skin more similar to the smooth scale of a snake than porous skin, and hair ranging from tawny browns to russet reds often short and clumped. Similarities tend to stop at this already-varied description, as each clan of barbozeen boast an incredibly diverse range of sizes, weights, and shapes, not to speak of culture.</p> <ul> <li>Barbozeen often reach maturity in their mid-20s, but some tribes experience a second, or even multiple, additional stages of growth some decades later, into their elderly 80s-90s.</li> <li>Their height tends on the taller side of human, at 6-8ft (2-2.4m, Size 4), though fly to the size of towering halfgiants and sink to the lows of the size of human children, at their most extreme.</li> <li>They often sport a muzzle of some variety, with somewhat larger canine teeth than many other races, sometimes verging on tusks. These can often be regrown if damaged, and some clans wear them as trophies or decoration in jewellery or clothing, and may be carved or dyed.</li> <li>Barbozeen can sometimes have boney protrusions and dense knobs in their skin, and have small or large horns, though not ever to the extent of antlers.</li> <li>Some barbozeen possess tails, which can be thick and lizardlike and short or long, or thin and tufted on the end, though these are much more extreme mutations.</li> <li>Overall, their traits can include IMPISH, LARGE, CANID, UNGULATE, REPTILIAN, MAMMALIAN, URSINE, CARNIVOROUS, OMNIVOROUS, and/or HUMANOID.</li> </ul> <p>Barbozeen are social enough as a tribe to group together into clans for family structure, and small bands of 4-6 while travelling together. Solitary 'zeen can sometimes be seen employed as warriors, bodyguards, or builders, though it is rare that they fail to bond with at least one other.</p> <p>Common clan observances include a more 'barbaric' lifestyle, as some who live in cities might say, constructing buildings and clothes roughly and for utility purposes, but also a distinct sense of honor and trust, and respect of heritage and ancestry. One unusual similarity between the clans is a culture of maskmaking, though each clan and individual tends to have their own unique spin on things. Some will wear them on the face, or around the head as a helmet, while others pad a shoulder, or a chestplate, or even carry it as a shield. The themes appear defensive and protective, much like a guardian spirit. Typically a coming-of-age ritual, a mask is carved of wood or bone, or even stone, and hold in great reverence, treating it partially as its own entity, partially an extension of the wearer and maker. These masks are only replaced when necessary, and even the taking of a new name will often only alter the existing mask. They are buried with their owner upon death, or as much of the mask retrieved as possible.</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","CreatureType","Tribe","Barbozeen"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/BARBOZEEN/#races","title":"RACES","text":"RACE DESCRIPTION STATS AORG Large and powerful fighters. 4 2 4 | 1 2 2 | 1 2 3 || Size 4-1 DeedLarge, Ursine, Canid HA-AORG Sister clan of the Aorg, more humanoid. 3 2 3 | 2 2 2 | 2 2 2 || Size 3Axe Use proficiencyCarnivorous, Reptilian GOBBH Diminuitive and evasive. 2 4 2 | 2 4 2 | 2 2 1 || Size 2Manipulation proficiency","tags":["CharacterSheet","CreatureType","Tribe","Barbozeen"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/BARBOZEEN/#stat-distribution","title":"STAT DISTRIBUTION","text":"<p>BARBOZEEN - 1 x9 = 9, add 13 advantages, add +2 each class for -1 Deed 1 1 1 | 1 1 1 | 1 1 1 || Size 2 - For 3, grant three +1, between Size +1 (2), +2 +1, or three +1s.

Thinner arms and legs end in larger hands and feet and head, including large pointed bat ears. - Can be extremely quick and precise, but also very intelligent and sociable. They will often use these traits to avoid direct confrontation, where they may be overpowered or threatened, and their comparably small size can work against them. - Hair of varying length on the back of the head, of darker browns to blue-oily blacks. - Smaller muzzle, with sharper teeth, and either large or small eyes, which can be effective at seeing in the dark. This can give them an impish, or even lizardlike appearance. - Much stronger skin color, of greens, browns, yellows, reds, or blues, that wrinkles and sags with age. - They may have a short, triangular, reptilian tail stub, a longer reptilian tail, or a thin tail with a tuft on the end.</p> <p>Cultural traits shared by the Gobbh clan: - Hair can be varied, but is common to tie back or cut if the length poses a risk. - Resources are distributed according to need, and large village structures, where parental responsibilities aren't strictly defined, mean that independent ownership is a foreign concept. As such, the Gobbh are not inherently covetous, providing resources and assistance when possible, but from the outside, can appear as criminals and thieves. - Village structures are often underground or in caves, where there is a significantly reduced risk of discovery and attack or invasion. A village may move locations as it's population grows or shrinks, or may split if the population grows too high. In such a case, village relocation is done quietly and discreetly, often to the extent that other nearby towns and cities are surprised by the discovery of Gobbh who have been nearby for months or even years, but the two halves of a split will often both relocate at the same time, parting as friend and family. - All Gobbh who deal with the outside world tend to develop at least one technique for risk avoidance or threat escape. This may be through speed, running into small cover or striking first, crafting devices that repel or defuse, casting spells from a safe distance, or having a network of allies and failsafes that intervene on their behalf. This makes them both incredibly desirable as specialists in many fields, while also earning ire and distrust, for being \"selfish\", or \"cowardly\". EQUIPMENT - Gobbh uphold the barbozeen tradition of masking by crafting one themselves. It is considered a respectable pastime to refine the mask, and replacing the mask with a new, better-crafted one isn't unheard of. Many Gobbh don't actually wear their mask, instead housing it in their den with any of their other belongings, which, like other belongings, is considered freely accessible to all. Personalization or representation by the mask is made that much more powerful by having it available to the world, though it's not clear why anyone would need it. This puts them at odds with other barbozeen clans, who covet their masks dearly, and the offer to trade or let them borrow a mask would baffle and infuriate other clans. - Tools and weapons, designed to go around obstacles, or through with as much speed, precision, and preparedness as possible, such as daggers, spyglasses, lockpicks, or tinkerers' tools. - Light or no armor, since the added bulk would only reduce the Gobbh's evasion, speed, or stealth. PROFICIENCY - Pick 4 per class selection - SIMPLE WEAPONS, that are either small enough to be used quickly, like daggers, or have the LONG trait, such as spears, to strike before being struck. - AMMUNITION WEAPONS, such as bows, or slings. - SHIELDS, of any size, to either deflect incoming hits with skill, or cover the entire body. - CRAFTS and MANIPULATION, to build custom equipment to size spec, and build their way out of problems. - ENTRAPMENT and STRATEGY, both to evade capture, as well as to undermine other larger and more dangerous creatures, and those who present a social obstacle. - HARVEST and HERBALISM, for MEDICINE, and poisons, and for a self-sufficient food source. - RESEARCH, RITUAL, SPIRITUALISM, and other magics. Gobbh enjoy the notion of producing effects independent of their otherwise small or weak stature. - ATHLETICS and STEALTH. Gobbh are able to run, jump, climb, and hide, if direct combat is avoided. - BINDING, HUSBANDRY, and RIDE: Gobbh may opt to tame creatures to perform their labor and fighting for them, and even ride creatures like wolves or large spiders. - DECEPTION, EMPATHY, MEDIATION, and PERSUASION are all tools a Gobbh may employ to be a savvy negotiator, brokering deals and deflecting threats. BELIEFS - COMPULSIONS: Extreme fight-flight-or-night response, to attack, run, retreat, or withdraw from attention exposed to sudden events, such as loud noise or shocking revelations, in order to process and approach the event from the ideal angle. - INTERPRETATIONS: Resources should be used for those who require them at the given moment. Confrontation can solve conflicts, and is sometimes the only or best way to do so, but preparation, patience, and evasion are also great tools to use, especially in combinations. - TRADITIONS: Gobbh will leave the nest in rotations, to seek and retrieve resources, to scout and explore, and to do combat and defend, when necessary. Each Gobbh is responsible for crafting a mask for themselves, out of any material and in any style they choose, and what the mask means is personal, including whether it's actually personal or not. - LAW: Those who do not take responsibility when it is their turn and are able, are merely a guest, to be respected and entertained, but eventually expelled, all without the trust and the family of kin. - TENET: Provide to those who are in need of what you are not yourself using. Pursue your own personal strength, and celebrate the strengths and triumphs of those who's strength you benefit from, as well as those who you grant your strengths to.</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","Race","Barbozeen","Gobbh"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/RACE/GOBBH/#typical-statblock","title":"TYPICAL STATBLOCK","text":"<p>1 4 1 | 2 4 2 | 1 2 1 || Size 2 Manipulation proficiency Stealth proficiency __ specialization, in a job, or hearing</p>","tags":["CharacterSheet","Tribe","Race","Barbozeen","Gobbh"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/CHARACTERS/CREATURE%20TYPES%20and%20SUBTYPES/TRIBE/RACE/HA-AORG/","title":"HA AORG","text":"<p>The Ha-Aorg, or \"half-ork\", have a root origin shared with the Aorg clan, though the significant differences in their appearance lead some scholars to believe that there was a schism in the community that lead similarly-minded barbozeen to leave, forming their own clan.</p> <p>Physical traits associated with the Ha-Aorg: - While still tall, Ha-Aorg average about 1.5-2m (Size 3), and tend to weigh quite heavily for their otherwise humanoid frame. - They are quicker than their Aorg cousins, both in physical speed and in temperament, faster to anger, to calm, and to humor. - Long, mane-like hair on the back of the head, of red and muddy browns, with occasional streaks of blond, black, or white hair. - Much more varied in build, the strong possess thick and heavy limbs and bodies, but there are also those who favor speed and precision, or intellect and wisdom, or social wellbeing. - A more powerful, defined jaw may or may not have larger teeth or any tusks at all. - A squarish face can have a more pronounced muzzle than what reads as human, more like a large cat, wolf, or bison. - Dark eyes are often sunk below a heavier brow. - Darker, yellower green scaleskin, that wrinkles and sags with high age.</p> <p>Cultural traits shared by those of the Ha-Aorg clan: - Hair is worn long and clumped, chopped roughly into shape, or tied  back using cord or braids. - Teeth or bone, which may be carved or dyed, sewn into clothing and dangling from cords. - Families live in a village constructed of tents with bent supports, stretching lengths of cloth or hide between them, decorated with dangling feather and bone chimes, and patterned with paints and simple dyes.

You want to be a leader, a strategist, or a beast-tamer, for there is strength in numbers, and power in companionship.</p> <p>Commanders, like Socialites, wield the strength of others, but also require strength of themselves. Often leading by example, Commanders are found in the thick of things, confidently giving orders for things that they themselves know how to do, and may have done for many years, and will even join in to do. As such, Commander is a role that can sit at the head of any of the other roles: the head of a team of researchers, a foreman at a build site, or the captain of a squad of soldiers. But while they may share the same responsibilities, Commanders may also feel alone, the weight of their responsibilities and stress of having to trust others to do the job right making them feel isolated.</p> <p>As a Commander, handing out orders is called a COMMAND. Communicating an idea to someone or something, granting them Intention, and generating additional value if they actually follow through, it's up to you to either learn more techniques and strategies, work on teambuilding so that your people understand what you want or trust you if they don't, or are so in tune with what you want that they'll do what you want unbidden, an independent extension of your will.</p> <p>Scenarios that may require a Commander: - WARRIOR, especially military, with a clear chain of command. - CRAFTER. Working together to build a castle, or sail a ship, or manage a kitchen. - DUNGEONEER. Being a leader of a small, diverse squad of specialists means learning to harness their myriad abilities quickly and effectively. - SAGE. Researchers drift between having laser focus on a particular subject, and being easily distracted by a new fascination. It's up to you to keep them on task, but also to take their wanderings seriously, because it could lead to new insights and discoveries. - SNEAK.

STRATEGY, CIVILIZATION, ENTRAPMENT Not only seeing an opportunity to take advantage of the current situation, but quickly drafting up a plan and having it executed, and awareness of what situations could cause your enemy to do the same. CRAFTS, RESEARCH, INSIGHT Being assigned teams who will perform specialized work on your behalf is often improved if you actually know what they're talking about. COGNIZANCE, EMPATHY, MEDIATION You're not infallible.

They may have been promoted to supervise other architects and builders, and relish the day that they can finally stop being the punching bag for why construction hasn't gone as smoothly or quickly as hoped. They may even pull on their strings from the shadows, their commands so subtle, so nuanced, that their 'subjects' even believe it was their own idea. Do they covet power?

This is either during, the result of, or leading to the first major action sequence, which should also establish what the OBJECTIVE of the story is. THE MONTAGE Once established, the characters move through a series of challenges, one after another, at a breakneck speed, seemingly unstoppable in their skill and talents. These challenges should be drawn as a result of pass-to-the-next, or draw-from-a-hat order of challenges that are practically tailor-made to be solved by this particular crew. This is a major opportunity for each of the characters to showcase their abilities, and possibly introduce additional elements of their backstory or personality. THE SETBACK The characters experience failure or defeat, possibly for the very first time, or a sudden betrayal, or boiling over of conflict between members of the group. Tensions should be raised, and all hope seem lost, as the true scope of their task looms in front of them. Nevertheless, the characters find some shared or personal reason to press on. THE FINALE After another series of challenges, the final objective is now achieved, through skill, a fatal enemy mistake, or even an act of extreme absurdity. The day one, the spoils looted and distributed (maybe), the dead buried, each character either departs the group, or together walks off into the sunset, and on to the possibility of future as-yet-untold adventures. ACTION ROLES: - The Hero: A dashing rogue with a heart of gold. Is usually the glue holding the group together. - The Antihero: Doesn't want to be in the group. They said so. Plays by their own rules. - The Romantic: Will often be the voice of reason, or a love interest. De-escalates tensions. - The Innocent: This may be a member of the crew, or a character picked up along the way. They often have some kind of insight or expertise that's surprisingly helpful, but their VIP nature often means keeping them alive at all costs. - The Driver: Delivers the crew to scene, master of the getaway vehicle and chase scene, probably can drive anything. Alternatively, the guy who knows a guy to get you in. - The Heavy: Uses weapons. Big ones. They usually don't care what the mission is, so long as they get to use those weapons. - The Sniper: Precision artisan, meticulous, calculating. Is often perceived as less trustworthy than the others. - The Acrobat: A ninja in just about every sense of the word, they bring a graceful flair to what otherwise amounts to gratuitous violence. - The Loose Cannon: Sometimes a demolitions expert, their somewhat unhinged enthusiasm is prone to getting them, and everyone around them, into trouble. ACTION MECHANICS: - Big Bomber: A single item or payoff strategy can be built up or acquired over the adventure, which will instantaneously succeed one skill check scenario, guaranteed, with flying colors. - Brute Force: Problems and obstacles that should ordinarily not be solvable with violence, are. Driving through walls, shooting blast doors shut, launching via explosions, etc. - Tis a Fleshwound: None of the injuries acquired during the adventure are lethal for long.","tags":["Tales","MovieMonster"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/CONSTRUCTING%20A%20STORY/TALES/DARK%20LORD/","title":"DARK LORD","text":"<p>DEFINE - VILLAIN - WORLD - SCHEME - HOPE</p> <p>AT THE END OF EVERY CHAPTER DRAW A CARD IF THE CARD IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DARK LORD OR HIS SCHEME, HIS GOALS PROGRESS, AND HE ADDS A NEW CARD TO THE DECK</p> <p>THE MORE CARDS HE HAS WHEN YOU CONFRONT HIM, THE HARDER THE DICE ROLL WILL BE</p> <p>EVERY CARD BELONGING TO THE DARK LORD YOU FLIP BECOMES A WEAPON YOU CAN USE AGAINST HIM IN THE FINAL FIGHT</p> <p>so, his cards were  [The Villain]: The Remedy, as an Event [The Scheme]: Order, inverted, as an Item [The World]: a Spirit (draw a card) as a (draw another card), ends up being a Spirit of The Void, and The Sun Inverted [The Hope]: The Forge, as a Person</p> <p>based on all of this I got:</p> <p>Our story is set in the distant future, one of bleak, sterile surfaces aboard a space station, while much of what remains of humanity rots at the hands of disease down on the planet below Our hero, or someone close to them, has contracted the disease, which is sure to wash across the station like a tide if they don't execute the infected first, as is procedure Our character has heard tell that there may be medicine, a cure, if you go through the black markets and avoid the 'proper channels', and the objective is to get in touch with the person who manufactures the vaccination before their infected status is discovered.</p>","tags":["Tales","MovieMonster"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/CONSTRUCTING%20A%20STORY/TALES/MOVIE%20MONSTER/","title":"MOVIE MONSTER","text":"<p>Monster movies, or Slashers, borrow a lot of elements from both Action and Horror.

It's only when it's too late to back out, do they finally realize that they're trapped in a spider's web, that very much wants them dead. MONSTER DO While the characters move from location to location, shoring up defenses, making repairs, and trying to accumulate enough Discovery successes to be allowed to leave, the monster is on the prowl. It'll use whatever means at it's disposal to track, stalk, ambush, chase, and destroy. WHO TRAPPED WHO After becoming familiar with the layout of the Theatre and it's various stages, it's time to set traps, rig distractions, or heft a really, really big weapon. This cinematic head is the most dangerous thus far, and someone may have to sacrifice themselves just to create a last opportunity for anyone to escape alive. There may even be a false end, where things seem resolved, but the slasher miraculously surges back to the fore. ESCAPE TO DAYLIGHT With the monster trapped or dead behind them, any surviving characters stumble back to a place of relative safety. They may tell others about their tale, or arm up just to come back and finish the job for good, but that's mostly beyond the scope of this tale. MONSTER ROLES: - THE INNOCENT: This may be a member of the crew, or a character picked up along the way. They often have some kind of insight or expertise that's surprisingly helpful, but their VIP nature often means keeping them alive at all costs. - THE FRONTLINER: This role is often a headstrong militant type. Their first, and often only strategy is to attack the monster head-on, shooting it, running it over, or stabbing it. Beyond that, they'll try to stay armed, more out of habit than for any real effectiveness against the enemy. The rest of the team can choose to give some of their cards to the Frontliner, in the hopes that they'll take the lead, and that those cards will actually amount to something. - THE ENGINEER: A specialist through and through, the Engineer proves their worth in the field, juryrigging resources, repairing broken engines or opening doors. Extremely practical, their efforts give the crew an enormous leg up in terms of turning their environment around, so that it doesn't work against them so badly. Turns active penalties, such as darkness, into advantages. - THE SCHOLAR: Their interests are almost purely academic, but they're usually just as fascinated by their circumstances as they are terrified of the danger. They'll whip up strategies, and produce various invaluable nuggets of trivia that means the crew won't have to rely on guessing as much. Using devices, and batteries, they can replicate any other role, but only once. MONSTER MECHANICS: - TICK TOCK: Whenever a span of time occurs, such as searching for clues, entering a room, or hiding, roll a d20. On a 20, the monster appears; if not, the threshold drops by 1. On an appearance, a successful Perception/Initiative check may grant the party an opportunity to do something first. - LOST HEARTBEAT: Rather than health, a standard deck of playing cards is doled out to the party, shuffled and face down. Whenever the monster appears, whoever gets attacked, either the Frontliner or someone at random, reveal cards one at a time until a red card is revealed, indicating that, somehow, this time, the character has survived. If no red cards have been revealed and the character runs out of cards, that character has been killed. Alternatively, as per Discovery rules, revealing the correlation value of multiple cards indicates how many red cards you must reveal to stay alive. - TAVERN BRAWLING: When the Frontliner is attacked by the monster, they can fight back, using a brand new, situationally relevant method of driving the creature off that hasn't been used before. If this skill check is successful, they only reveal the top card of their Lost Heartbeat deck, or one red card, rather than cards until red or as many red cards as the creature dealt damage.","tags":["Tales","MovieMonster"]},{"location":"Road%20and%20Ruin/CONSTRUCTING%20A%20STORY/TALES/MYSTERY/","title":"MYSTERY","text":"<p>Mysteries are tales of discovery, and revolve entirely around the hook of the unknown.

These questions can come about suddenly, or as the result of more observant characters who noticed something was amiss, and are determined to get to the bottom of things. GATHER CLUES By seeking out evidence, either in different locations or held by other characters, or following a lead presented by evidence, the characters start to piece together the puzzle of what it is that has transpired here. Sometimes, evidence leads to a dead end, and sometimes it can set you on the wrong path altogether, a 'red herring', that needs to be noticed and reexamined. Once all the available information has been gathered and arranged, it may present a narrative, most commonly defined by a Motive. THE TWIST Satisfied that the mystery is solved and wrongs are righted, one final stumbling block appears: something that was once known to be true, is now discovered to have been false, and this new information completely unravels the rest of the theory. But this falsehood is, in itself, a new clue, one that points to the truth when followed. MYSTERY SOLVED Having pursued the twist to its inevitable conclusion, the case is closed. Criminals are behind bars, victims avenged, a device activated, or a puzzle solved, the characters are now free to return to their lives, or push onward to the next adventure.
